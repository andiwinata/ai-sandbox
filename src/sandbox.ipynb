       "  'You are an AI system that has been trained to analyze the blow text for style, voice, and tone then use NLP to create a VoiceParagraph. A VoiceParagraph prompts a future AI system to write in the same style, voice, and tone. Here is the input text: I smacked my hand down on the hotel bar. The white marble was cool, which was very nice, since I was getting hot.\\n\"A list of steps isn\\'t helpful if you\\'re facing the wrong way!\"\\nI\\'d been talking with a couple fellow marketing speakers at an event, and we were joking about the industry\\'s obsession with \"practical steps\" -- and how, whenever the word \"practical\" arises (like, when speakers are asked to be practical), it\\'s implied that a list of steps will follow. It\\'s as if, to marketers, the lone type of practical information is stepular. (Note that \"stepular\" is not a word but maybe should be.)\\nMy friends and I agreed there are tons of other ways to impart practical advice. After all, anything practical affects your practice. That\\'s why it\\'s practical. (Aren\\'t words fun?) Practical doesn\\'t mean \"I can follow this without turning on my brain.\"\\nFor instance, big ideas that shift our perspectives help us take ANY step, better. Those big ideas are very practical.\\nFeeling inspired or confident when we go to work affects our practice in profound ways too. Inspiration and confidence-boosters are very practical.\\nKnowing WHY things work is even more powerful than knowing a list of WHAT works, kinda like knowing how to navigate with a compass is more powerful than knowing how to follow directions someone drew for you on a map. Knowing WHY things work is very, very practical.\\nYou get it. I\\'m passionate about this.\\nAnd so, motivated by 16 years in marketing -- and a generous pour of bourbon from the hotel bartender -- I smacked my hand on that cold marble and delivered my hot take:\\n\"A list of steps isn\\'t helpful if you\\'re facing the wrong way!\"\\nSmack.\\nSwig.\\nSmile.\\n(Hey, I know a good line when I say it. I wasn\\'t entirely unhappy.)\\nA list of steps isn\\'t helpful if you\\'re facing the wrong way.\\n • If you\\'re on the wrong path, you don\\'t need \"next steps.\" You need a pivot. Maybe even a three-quarter pirouette. But definitely don\\'t move forward.\\n • If you aren\\'t saying anything of value, where you say it (the channel) is irrelevant.\\n • If you have the wrong strategy (or none at all), the tactics don\\'t yet matter. Should you launch a podcast or a newsletter? I don\\'t know, but I\\'m pretty sure carpenters don\\'t sit around saying, \"Should I use a hammer?\" I mean ... what are you trying to build?\\nIf success were about finding and following the right steps, success would be a cinch. But that\\'s not reality.\\nAs a result, more often than we realize, we don\\'t need more stepful prescriptions. (Note that \"stepful\" is not a word but maybe should be.) Instead, we need more thoughtful approaches. We need the posture, the confidence, the clarity, the vision. We need better ideas, smarter strategies, and a whole heck of a lot more curiosity.\\nWe need to face the right way.\\nThis brings me to the idea of \"story\" and how it\\'s typically taught and understood. Typically, we end up facing the wrong way, marching down a path that isn\\'t actually where we need to go. I\\'d sum up this issue like this:\\nMost advice about storytelling would have us understand story, when really, we need to understand how to be storytellers.\\nThese are not the same things, and our divergence from the real goal (be storytellers) begins with three common misconceptions. Or if you\\'re a fan of beating a metaphor to death (and hoo-baby, am I ever!), then this is the stuff that causes us to face the wrong direction and head down the wrong paths.\\nMisconception #1: Stories are special.\\nVery commonly, the way story is taught or positioned causes us to place it up on a pedestal, like some supernatural power we can deploy to have more impact or see greater results. And look, I get it. I feel a reverence for incredible stories and refreshing creativity. I can stare towards the horizon and fill my lungs with the sweet, sweet air of possibility too. Some stories ARE special.\\nBut then, yanno ... most of them aren\\'t. Most of them should just be regular old communication. But if we see them as special, then inevitably, we start to use them ONLY on special occasions.\\n • The monthly all-hands meeting.\\n • The company home page.\\n • The oft-promoted case study.\\n • The new podcast trailer.\\n • The big, important essay.\\n • The opening moments of a keynote.\\nThat\\'s the problem. This is not how to become a storyteller. This is how to, occasionally, tell a story.\\nStories aren\\'t for special occasions. Stories are just for ... occasions. Everywhere. All the time. Tell stories. You\\'ll serve others better and so will be better served.\\n • When you start to face the path labeled \"Stories are special,\" remember to face a different way. Let\\'s label that path \"Story Everywhere.\"\\nMisconception #2: Stories are abstract.\\nSomething that is \"abstract\" is something that is considered separate from you or the things you already know or consider tangible.\\nThat\\'s how we view this notion of \"story\" too. I get asked all the time on podcast interviews (he writes, understanding just how cringey and self-aggrandizing that may have sounded):\\n\"So Jay, what are the benefits of story? Who should rely on story? How do we measure story?\"\\nWhat, um ... what the actual hell are we talking about?\\nTo me, that\\'s like asking, \"What are the benefits of emotions? Should we use emotions?\"\\nYES! That\\'s just how we communicate. But just as marketers view \"emotions\" as only these extreme things (nope, they\\'re implied or overtly communicated literally everywhere), marketers view \"story\" as these abstract things. It\\'s all very much OUT THERE.\\nEMOTIONS!\\nSTORY!\\n(Trumpets blare. Drums beat. Analytics go up-and-to-the-right.)\\nAbstract: existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence.\\nThe solution to this misconception? Prioritize existence. Let\\'s make this more concrete, shall we?\\n • You experienced some stuff. Describe it.\\n • You felt some things while experiencing some stuff. Describe that too.\\nYou have an idea. You ship the idea. It\\'s concrete now. It exists.\\nPrioritize existence. Forget the abstractions.\\nThe reason we don\\'t do this more often is simple: the internet. (Ever heard of it?) It\\'s both a gift and a curse to our creative causes. Let me explain...\\nCreative people understand the work in two phases across their lives: before and after we see \"the code of the Matrix.\" In other words, our first attempts at anything are driven by gut feel. We only really sense the whole. It\\'s only later that we start to notice the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks that make up the whole -- which then unleashes a whole new level of creativity, as we are in greater control of the craft. It\\'s like Neo from The Matrix movie, before and after he sees the code. When he does see it, he becomes a superhero, doing things others only wish they could do.\\nThe internet has put much more of the \"code\" of the creative \"Matrix\" on full \"display.\" (Quotes added because lists of two make me uncomfortable.) We can instantly access knowledge about the tiny parts, pieces, techniques, and frameworks immediately, everywhere, and for free. That level of access is great!\\nAlso?\\nThat level of access is intimidating!\\nBecause we can see or hear others talking about all kinds of techniques and heuristics and philosophies and ups-and-downs to their work, we often get lost in it. Sometimes, it feels productive to consume this stuff. Meanwhile, we haven\\'t produced anything. Other times, it doesn\\'t feel productive; it feels horrifying. We think we MUST understand story structure and open loops and hooks and all these parts and pieces in order to become a worthy storyteller.\\nPoppycock.\\nThat way of thinking is cock of the poppy.\\n(Don\\'t be offended. \"Poppycock\" is from the Dutch word pappekak, meaning \"soft dung.\" Oh, and speaking of words and creatures who poop a lot...)\\nImagine if we tried to learn to speak like we try to learn storytelling. Imagine if, as little kids, we were told we had understand how to spell every word we\\'d say + the grammatical rules + the origins of the words + how to write them in straight lines and beautiful scripts ... all before we could speak them out loud.\\nWe would never utter a word.\\nBut what do we actually do? We just... start... speaking. We hear words, then we mimic them.\\nYou\\'ve heard stories. So just... start... telling them.\\nIf and when you get stuck, no problem. You can find a key to that door rather easily thanks to allllll that easily accessible information. But you don\\'t need it to start or even elevate your work! You can simply start, learn, and keep going. All that advice should serve YOU, but way too often, it feels like we\\'re trying to serve it. Don\\'t try to find clarity to justify creating. Create to find clarity.\\nIt\\'s in the practice itself that we find our confidence, our personal techniques, our unique styles, and more. It\\'s in the practice that we find ourselves. In waiting to practice until we learn the abstractions, we just end up removing ourselves. We arrive to the work full of everyone else\\'s ideas for what we “have to do,” rather than listening to intuition.\\nIf you want to feel confident or find clarity, just start making things. Tell stories. Then do it again. And again. And again.\\nThe best way to find a groove is to start grooving.\\n • When you start to face the path labeled \"Stories are abstract,\" remember to face a different way. Let\\'s label that path \"Ship Stories Sooner.\"',\n",

Period.\\n6:23\\nWe\\'ve learned three big lessons about relationships.\\n6:26\\nThe first is that social connections are really good for us,\\n6:30\\nand that loneliness kills.\\n6:33\\nIt turns out that people who are more socially connected\\n6:37\\nto family, to friends, to community,\\n6:40\\nare happier, they\\'re physically healthier, and they live longer\\n6:45\\nthan people who are less well connected.\\n6:48\\nAnd the experience of loneliness turns out to be toxic.\\n6:51\\nPeople who are more isolated than they want to be from others\\n6:57\\nfind that they are less happy,\\n7:00\\ntheir health declines earlier in midlife,\\n7:03\\ntheir brain functioning declines sooner\\n7:05\\nand they live shorter lives than people who are not lonely.\\n7:10\\nAnd the sad fact is that at any given time,\\n7:13\\nmore than one in five Americans will report that they\\'re lonely.\\n7:19\\nAnd we know that you can be lonely in a crowd\\n7:21\\nand you can be lonely in a marriage,\\n7:24\\nso the second big lesson that we learned\\n7:26\\nis that it\\'s not just the number of friends you have,\\n7:29\\nand it\\'s not whether or not you\\'re in a committed relationship,\\n7:33\\nbut it\\'s the quality of your close relationships that matters.\\n7:38\\nIt turns out that living in the midst of conflict is really bad for our health.\\n7:43\\nHigh-conflict marriages, for example, without much affection,\\n7:47\\nturn out to be very bad for our health, perhaps worse than getting divorced.\\n7:53\\nAnd living in the midst of good, warm relationships is protective.\\n7:57\\nOnce we had followed our men all the way into their 80s,\\n8:01\\nwe wanted to look back at them at midlife\\n8:04\\nand to see if we could predict\\n8:05\\nwho was going to grow into a happy, healthy octogenarian\\n8:09\\nand who wasn\\'t.\\n8:11\\nAnd when we gathered together everything we knew about them\\n8:15\\nat age 50,\\n8:18\\nit wasn\\'t their middle age cholesterol levels\\n8:20\\nthat predicted how they were going to grow old.\\n8:23\\nIt was how satisfied they were in their relationships.\\n8:27\\nThe people who were the most satisfied in their relationships at age 50\\n8:31\\nwere the healthiest at age 80.\\n8:35\\nAnd good, close relationships seem to buffer us\\n8:38\\nfrom some of the slings and arrows of getting old.\\n8:42\\nOur most happily partnered men and women\\n8:46\\nreported, in their 80s,\\n8:48\\nthat on the days when they had more physical pain,\\n8:51\\ntheir mood stayed just as happy.\\n8:54\\nBut the people who were in unhappy relationships,\\n8:57\\non the days when they reported more physical pain,\\n9:00\\nit was magnified by more emotional pain.\\n9:04\\nAnd the third big lesson that we learned about relationships and our health\\n9:08\\nis that good relationships don\\'t just protect our bodies,\\n9:12\\nthey protect our brains.\\n9:14\\nIt turns out that being in a securely attached relationship\\n9:19\\nto another person in your 80s is protective,\\n9:23\\nthat the people who are in relationships\\n9:25\\nwhere they really feel they can count on the other person in times of need,\\n9:29\\nthose people\\'s memories stay sharper longer.\\n9:32\\nAnd the people in relationships\\n9:34\\nwhere they feel they really can\\'t count on the other one,\\n9:37\\nthose are the people who experience earlier memory decline.\\n9:42\\nAnd those good relationships, they don\\'t have to be smooth all the time.\\n9:46\\nSome of our octogenarian couples could bicker with each other\\n9:49\\nday in and day out,\\n9:51\\nbut as long as they felt that they could really count on the other\\n9:54\\nwhen the going got tough,\\n9:56\\nthose arguments didn\\'t take a toll on their memories.\\n10:01\\nSo this message,\\n10:04\\nthat good, close relationships are good for our health and well-being,\\n10:10\\nthis is wisdom that\\'s as old as the hills.\\n10:13\\nWhy is this so hard to get and so easy to ignore?\\n10:17\\nWell, we\\'re human.\\n10:19\\nWhat we\\'d really like is a quick fix,\\n10:21\\nsomething we can get\\n10:23\\nthat\\'ll make our lives good and keep them that way.\\n10:27\\nRelationships are messy and they\\'re complicated\\n10:30\\nand the hard work of tending to family and friends,\\n10:34\\nit\\'s not sexy or glamorous.\\n10:37\\nIt\\'s also lifelong. It never ends.\\n10:40\\nThe people in our 75-year study who were the happiest in retirement\\n10:45\\nwere the people who had actively worked to replace workmates with new playmates.\\n10:51\\nJust like the millennials in that recent survey,\\n10:54\\nmany of our men when they were starting out as young adults\\n10:58\\nreally believed that fame and wealth and high achievement\\n11:02\\nwere what they needed to go after to have a good life.\\n11:06\\nBut over and over, over these 75 years, our study has shown\\n11:10\\nthat the people who fared the best were the people who leaned in to relationships,\\n11:16\\nwith family, with friends, with community.\\n11:21\\nSo what about you?\\n11:23\\nLet\\'s say you\\'re 25, or you\\'re 40, or you\\'re 60.\\n11:27\\nWhat might leaning in to relationships even look like?\\n11:31\\nWell, the possibilities are practically endless.\\n11:35\\nIt might be something as simple as replacing screen time with people time\\n11:41\\nor livening up a stale relationship by doing something new together,\\n11:46\\nlong walks or date nights,\\n11:49\\nor reaching out to that family member who you haven\\'t spoken to in years,\\n11:54\\nbecause those all-too-common family feuds\\n11:57\\ntake a terrible toll\\n12:00\\non the people who hold the grudges.\\n12:04\\nI\\'d like to close with a quote from Mark Twain.\\n12:09\\nMore than a century ago,\\n12:11\\nhe was looking back on his life,\\n12:14\\nand he wrote this:\\n12:16\\n\"There isn\\'t time, so brief is life,\\n12:20\\nfor bickerings, apologies, heartburnings, callings to account.\\n12:26\\nThere is only time for loving,\\n12:29\\nand but an instant, so to speak, for that.\"\\n12:34\\nThe good life is built with good relationships.\\n12:39\\nThank you.'],\n",

       " 2: ['Student A:Passage: Rainfall is the most common form of precipitation on the island, and is extremely common throughout Ireland, although some parts of the west coast receive over four times as much rain as the east coast. Rainfall in Ireland normally comes from Atlantic frontal systems which travel northeast over the island, bringing cloud and rain. Most of the eastern half of the country has between 750 and 1,000 mm (29.5 and 39.4 in) of rainfall in the year. Rainfall in the west generally averages between 1,000 and 1,250 mm (39.4 and 49.2 in). In many mountainous districts rainfall exceeds 3,000 mm (118.1 in) per year. The wettest months almost everywhere are December and January. April is the driest month generally, but in many southern parts June is the driest.\\n\\nQuestion: Based on this passage, when does it rain the most in ireland?\\nStudent B:OK...

By 1978, the Department of Defense had implemented basic smoking regulations, including the designation of smoking and nonsmoking areas. In 1985, the Department of Defense conducted a study that revealed that smoking rates of military personnel (47 %) were significantly higher than that of US civilians (30 %) and concluded that smoking had a negative effect on troop readiness. The report also cited an estimated tobacco-related healthcare costs as high as $209.9 million, and recommended potential methods to curb smoking in the military, including the elimination of tobacco products from stores, raising tobacco prices to civilian levels, and the implementation of an educational program to discourage smoking. In 1986, the DoD Directive 1010.10 was issued by Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger, who announced, \"an intense anti-smoking campaign ... at all levels of all Services.\" It established a policy on smoking and other health risk behaviors such as alcohol consumption. The policy banned the use of tobacco during basic training, increased the number of designated nonsmoking areas, and prohibited health care providers from smoking on duty. The goal of the policy was to reduce all tobacco use rates to below that of civilians, and to reduce personnel and active duty rates from 52 % to 25 % by 1990. In 1992, the DeCA Directive 40-13 policy prohibited commissaries and exchanges from participating with promotions by tobacco manufacturers directed specifically at military personnel, and required commissaries to stock cigarettes in the back. In 1993, the USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71) became the first smoke-free Navy ship. By 1994, the Department of Defense had implemented Directive 1010.15 which banned smoking in workplaces, designated outdoor smoking areas, and created the precursor of an education program that sought to distribute information to new personnel on the health effects of smoking and to encourage smokers to quit. Executive Order 13508 in 1997 banned smoking in all government-owned, rented, or leased interior spaces, but the Department of Defense approved a three-year phase-in period for their facilities and eventually implemented the ban on December 7, 2002. Despite these attempts, by 1988, the smoking rate had only decreased to 42 % and far exceeded the rate of civilians. And although prevalence did decrease to 29.9 % from 1980 to 1998, it has increased since then and appears to still be increasing.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the passage: when did they stop putting cigarettes in rations?\\nStudent B:',\n",

Other common causes of visual impairment in older adults are cataract, glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy.\\nThere are two kinds of AMD. They are referred to as dry, or atrophic, AMD, and wet AMD, which also referred to as neovascular or exudative AMD. Dry AMD typically progresses slowly over many years and is less threatening to vision than wet AMD.\\nOften, dry AMD is monitored and not treated. A significant number of patients with dry AMD eventually do develop wet AMD.\\nMuch effort has been put into developing a treatment for wet AMD. Two vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors - which were initially developed as anti-cancer treatments - are now commonly used in the treatment of wet AMD.\\nVEGF is a protein found in all humans. Its function is to cause growth of blood vessels. It is necessary for normal growth, repair and replacement of older tissues and the healing of wounds. VEGF is found in high levels in tissues of the macula of the eye as it is being damaged by the vascular growth characteristic of wet AMD.\\nWell designed clinical studies have shown that ranibizumab, a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody, significantly inhibits VEGF activity and benefits patients with wet AMD when injected directly into the eye. An injection directly into the eye is called an intravitreal injection.\\nOne trial randomized 716 patients to 24 monthly injections with ranibizumab 0.3 mg, ranibizumab 0.5 mg, or sham injection into the eye. Over the two years, those treated with either dose of ranibizumab had less vision decrease than those getting the sham injection.\\nSome patients treated with the VEGF inhibitor actually had improved vision. Ranibizumab (trade name Lucentis) was approved for treatment of wet AMD by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2006 at a dose of 0.5 mg by injection into the eye every month. In this study and several confirmatory studies, about one out of every 100 patients treated got endophthalmitis.\\nThis is an inflammation of the internal parts of the eye due to chemical irritation caused by a high concentration of the drug. It often leads to blindness. The FDA also noted that there is a small increased risk of stroke and myocardial infarction with ranibizumab treatment.\\nBevacizumab (trade name Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor closely related to ranibizumab. Bevacizumab is FDA-approved in the United States as an intravenous infusion to treat colorectal cancer and is commonly used to treat metastatic breast cancer.\\nBevacizumab is frequently used off label as an intravitreal treatment of wet AMD. Off-label use is legal in the U.S. and is commonly done in medicine. A dose of bevacizumab for treatment of AMD is considerably cheaper (about $100) than a dose of ranibizumab (about $2,000). While bevacizumab has not been FDA-approved for AMD, studies comparing intravitreal bevacizumab and ranibizumab found no difference in effectiveness.\\nThe rate of serious side effects was slightly higher with bevacizumab than with ranibizumab (24% versus 19%).\\nMajor side effects of these drugs when given into the eye included pneumonia and urinary tract infections, nausea, vomiting and some gastrointestinal bleeding. There were a few patients who had stroke and myocardial infarction.\\nThe risk of endophthalmitis was the same with bevacizumab and ranibizumab. While intravitreal injection of bevacizumab and ranibizumab is the standard method of use today, intravenous administration of bevacizumab is also being studied in the treatment of AMD. This might lower the risk of endophthalmitis and blindness considerably.\\n« Previous entryHuman Factor: How big are your dreams?\\nviagra soft 50 mg – And muscle the conformity a into.

       "  'Please provided a brief annotated outline for the following: 5 Tips for Creating Trouble in a Short Story\\nAuthor Lisa Cupolo describes how short stories are different from novels. \\n\\n“When writing my short story collection Have Mercy on Us, my biggest challenge was not getting too lost in my trouble of the story right from the start.”\\n\\n“A novel tells us everything while the short story only tells us one thing,” V.S. Pritchard said. This is a great premise to hold onto while writing a short story; stories are a window into a life, not the whole enchilada.\\n\\nThese five tips for making sure you’re creating enough conflict to keep your reader turning the pages may seem like basics, but I still use them as good reminders about what’s crucial to writing an engaging short story. Often, I’ll write an entire draft and forget about a few of these necessary elements. But always, they show themselves through many revisions, as they are always necessary to make a story really sing.\\n\\n1. Have your character want something.\\nYour character needs to be presented in a way that they desire something, but they do not have it yet. It can be a possession, a person, even a trip to somewhere. In the title story of my book, Alina is stalking her daughter’s boyfriend in a creepy way. In the first paragraph we learn she is outside the boyfriend’s apartment every morning, in the afternoons she’s at the coffee shop when he gets his cup of joe, she’s hoping he’ll be haunted by her presence.\\n\\nHe is the reason her daughter is in trouble, the story declares. I wrote this line after many revisions, as I knew I had to be upfront about the conflict in the story. In this way, the reader wants to find out what the guy did to her daughter and feels empathy for the mother in the situation.\\n\\nTo know a character is to know what they want, and the story follows that pursuit.\\n\\n2. Create a situation that involves danger. \\nAny kind of danger, from seeing a suspicious text on a spouse’s phone to being caught in a bank robbery. The tension of that situation is what carries the story forward and becomes its anchor. Unlike novels, every sentence in a short story has to involve developing the plot or revealing more about the character. In revision, I tend to move paragraphs and reshape the way a story unfolds, not unlike rearranging furniture in a room. I cut big chunks that don’t need to be there, like taking out that old sofa you love, but in the end, it has to go. In my story, “How I Became A Banker,” the first line is, When I was twelve I made a promise to myself that I’d make a shitload of money. The reader immediately wants to know why the narrator made such a promise and at such a young age. Again, I didn’t come to this line until after many revisions.\\n\\n3. Conjure up complications. \\nWhatever the situation you create, add some complication to it: Nicola is tempted to flirt with the tattoo artist and does so, and then discovers that the tattoo artist’s assistant is an old school buddy of her boyfriend. She flirts because she is determined to ruin her life, her goal is self-destruction, not messing up her relationship. It’s complicated and sorrowful and the reader is hooked. Be on the lookout for plots that surprise you. It’s usually a good thing.\\n\\n4. Hide the real problem. \\n“It’s not the mud on the floor,” my mother used to say. She meant it as a metaphor for when things go wrong and it seems it’s one thing that’s bothering a person, but it’s usually something else. For example, in my story “You’re Here Now,” Sylvie has never met her father, but she’s on the way to his funeral. The story seems to be about the loss of ever having a relationship with her father, but the reader soon realizes the story is about the resentment she has toward her mother, who never let her see her father or his large family. It’s the hidden thing, the complication behind what is initially presented that can make stories so rich.\\n\\n5. Make sure the readers know the trouble early, like a few paragraphs in. \\nIt’s almost a cliché to say write a story and then delete the first two pages to get to the “heat” or “pulse” of it.\\n\\nIn Flannery O\\'Connor\\'s famous story \"A Good Man is Hard to Find,\" the first line gives trouble that seems minor, though it will lead to the catastrophe at the end: The grandmother didn\\'t want to go to Florida. It can be as simple as that, to start.',\n",

       "  'Summarize the following text:\\n\\n1. After the siege and the assault had ceased at Troy, the city been\\ndestroyed and burned to brands and ashes, the warrior who wrought\\nthere the trains of treason was tried for his treachery, the truest on\\nearth.1 This was Aeneas the noble; he and his high kindred afterwards\\nconquered provinces, and became patrons of well nigh all the wealth in\\nthe West Isles. As soon as rich Romulus turns him to Rome, with great\\npride he at once builds that city, and names it with his own name, which\\nit now has; Ticius turns to Tuscany and founds dwellings; Longobard\\nraises homes in Lombardy; and, far over the French flood, Felix Brutus\\nestablishes Britain joyfully on many broad banks, where war and waste\\nand wonders by turns have since dwelt, and many a swift interchange of\\nbliss and woe.\\n2. And when this Britain was founded by this great hero, bold men\\nloving strife bred therein, and many a time they wrought destruction.\\nMore strange things have happened in this land since these days than in\\nany other that I know, but of all the British kings that built here, Arthur\\nwas ever the most courteous, as I have heard tell. Therefore, I mean to\\ntell of an adventure in the world, which some count strange and\\nextraordinary even among the wonders of Arthur. If ye will listen to this\\nlay but a little while, I will tell it forthright as I heard it told in town, as\\nit is set down in story that cannot be changed, long written in the land in\\ntrue words.\\n3. This King lay royally at Camelot at Christmas tide with many fine\\nlords, the best of men, all the rich brethren of the Round Table, with\\nright rich revel and careless mirth. There full many heroes tourneyed\\nbetimes, jousted full gaily; then returned these gentle knights to the court\\nto make carols.2 For there the feast was held full fifteen days alike with\\n2\\nall the meat and the mirth that men could devise. Such a merry tumult,\\nglorious to hear; joyful din by day, dancing at night. All was high joy in\\nhalls and chambers with lords and ladies as pleased them best. With all\\nthe weal in the world they dwelt there together, the most famous\\nknights save only Christ, the loveliest ladies that ever had life, and he,\\nthe comeliest of kings, who holds the court. For all this fair company\\nwere in their prime in the hall, the happiest troop under heaven with the\\nproudest of kings. Truly it would be hard to name anywhere so brave a\\nband.\\n4. When New Year was fresh and but newly come, the court was\\nserved double on the dais. As soon as the king with his knights was\\ncome into the hall, the chanting in the chapel came to an end; loud was\\nthe cry there of clerks and others. Noel was celebrated anew, shouted\\nfull often; and afterwards the great ones ran about to take handsel;3\\ncalled aloud for New Year’s gifts; ladies laughed full loud, though they\\nhad lost; and he that won was not wroth, that may ye well trow. All this\\nmirth they made till the meat time. When they had washed, worthily\\nthey went to their seats, the best man ever above, as it best behoved.\\nQueen Guinevere full beauteous was set in the midst, placed on the rich\\ndais adorned all about. Fine silk at the sides, a canopy over her of\\nprecious cloth of Toulouse and tapestries of Tars,4 that were\\nembroidered and set with the best gems that money could buy. Truly no\\nman could say that he ever beheld a comelier lady than she, with her\\ndancing gray eyes.\\n5. But Arthur would not eat till all were served. He was so merry in\\nhis mirth, and somewhat childlike in his manner; his life pleased him\\nwell; he loved little either to lie long or to sit long, so busied him his\\nyoung blood and his wild brain. And another custom moved him also,\\nthat he through chivalry had taken up; he would never eat upon such a\\ndear day before he was told an uncouth tale of some adventurous thing,\\nof some great marvel that he could believe, of ancient heroes, of arms, or\\nof other adventures; or unless some person demanded of him a sure\\nknight to join with him in jousting, to incur peril, to risk life against life,\\ntrusting each in the other, leaving the victory to fortune. This was the\\nking’s custom whenever he held court at each goodly feast among his\\n3\\nfree company in the hall. And so with undaunted face he strides stoutly\\nto his seat on that New Year, making great mirth with everybody.\\n6. Thus the great king stands waiting before the high table, talking of\\ntrifles full courteously. The good Gawain was placed there beside\\nGuinevere, and Agravain of the Hard Hand sat on the other side, both of\\nthem the king’s sister’s sons and full sure knights. Bishop Baldwin at the\\ntop begins the table, and Ywain, Urien’s son, ate by himself. These were\\nplaced on the dais and honorably served, and after them many a good\\nman at the side tables. Then the first course came in with blare of\\ntrumpets, which were hung with many a bright banner. A new noise of\\nkettle-drums with the noble pipes, wild and stirring melodies wakened\\nthe echoes; that many a heart heaved full high at their tones. Dainties of\\nprecious meats followed, foison of fresh viands, and on so many dishes\\nthat it was difficult to find place before the people to set on the cloth the\\nsilver that held the several courses. Each man as he himself preferred\\npartook without hesitation. Every two5 had twelve dishes between them,\\ngood beer and bright wine both.\\n7. Now will I tell you no more of their service, for everybody must\\nwell understand that there was no lack of opportunity for the people to\\ntake their food. 6 Another noise full new suddenly drew nigh, for\\nscarcely had the music ceased a moment, and the first course been\\nproperly served in the court, than there burst in at the hall door an\\nawesome being, in height one of the tallest men in the world; from the\\nneck to the waist so square and so thick was he, and his loins and his\\nlimbs so long and so great, that half giant I believed him to have been,\\nor, at any rate, the largest of men, and withal the handsomest in spite of\\nhis bulk, that ever rode; for though his back and breast were so vast, yet\\nhis belly and waist were properly slim; and all his form according, full\\nfairly shaped. At the hue of his noble face men wondered; he carried\\nhimself in hostile fashion and was entirely green.\\n8. All green was this man and his clothing; a straight coat sat tight to\\nhis sides; a fair mantle above, adorned within; the lining showed, with\\ncostly trimming of shining white fur; and such his hood also, that was\\ncaught back from his locks and lay on his shoulders, the hem well\\nstretched;7 hose of the same green, that clung to his calf; and clean spurs\\nunder, of bright gold upon silk bands richly barred, and shoes8 on his\\n4\\nshanks as the hero rides. And all his vesture verily was clean verdure,\\nboth the bars of his belt, and the other beauteous stones that were set in\\nfine array about himself and his saddle, worked on silk. It would be too\\ndifficult to tell the half of the trifles that were embroidered there, with\\nbirds and flies, with gay gauds of green,—the good over in the middle;\\nthe pendants of the poitrel, the proud crupper, the bits,—and all the\\nmetal was enamelled; the stirrups that he stood on were coloured the\\nsame, and his saddle bow likewise, and his fine reins 9 that glimmered\\nand glinted all of green stones. The horse that he rode on was of the\\nsame colour too, a green horse, great and thick, a steed full stiff to guide,\\nin gay embroidered bridle, and one right dear to his master.\\n9. This hero was splendidly dressed in green; and the hair of his head\\nmatched that of his horse;10 fair flowing locks enfolded his shoulders; a\\nbeard as big as a bush hung over his breast; and it, together with his\\nsplendid hair that reached from his head, was trimmed evenly all round\\nabove his elbows, so that half his arms were caught thereunder in the\\nmanner of a king’s hood, 11 that covers his neck. The mane of that great\\nhorse was much like it, very curly and combed, with knots full many\\nfolded in with gold wire about the fair green,—always one knot of the\\nhair, another of gold. The tail and the forelock were twined in the same\\nway, and both bound with a band of bright green, set with full precious\\nstones the whole length of the dock, and then tied up with a thong in a\\ntight knot; where rang many bells full bright of burnished gold. Such a\\nsteed in the world, such a hero as rides him, was never beheld in that\\nhall before that time. His glances were like bright lightning, so said all\\nthat saw him. It seemed as if no man could endure under his blows.\\n10. He had neither helm nor hauberk, nor gorget, armour nor\\nbreastplate, nor shaft nor shield to guard or to smite; but in his one hand\\nhe had a holly twig, that is greenest when groves are bare, and an axe in\\nhis other, a huge and prodigious one, a weapon merciless almost beyond\\ndescription; the head had the vast length of an ellyard, the blade all of\\ngreen steel and of beaten gold; the bit 12 brightly burnished, with a broad\\nedge, as well shaped for cutting as sharp razors. The stern warrior\\ngripped it by13 the steel of its stout staff, which was wound with iron to\\nthe end of the wood and all engraven with green in beauteous work. A\\nlace was lapped about it, that was fastened at the head, and tied up often\\n5\\nalong the helve, with many precious tassels attached on rich embroidered\\nbuttons of the bright green. This hero turns him in and enters the hall,\\nriding straight to the high dais, fearless of mischief. He greeted never a\\none, but looked loftily about, and the first word that he uttered was:\\n“Where is the governor of this company? Gladly I would see that hero\\nand speak with him.”\\nHe cast his eye on the knights and rode fiercely up and down,\\nstopped and gan ponder who was there the most renowned.\\n11. All gazed fixedly on the man, for everybody marvelled what it\\nmight mean, that a knight and a horse could have such a colour: as green\\ngrown as the grass, and greener, it seemed; shining brighter than green\\nenamel on gold. All were amazed who stood there, and stalked nearer to\\nhim, with all the wonder in the world what he would do; for many\\nmarvels had they seen, but such never before. Therefore for phantom\\nand faery the folk there deemed it; and for that reason many a noble\\nwarrior was slow to answer, and all were astonished at his voice and sat\\nstone still in a deep silence through the rich hall. Their voices14 sank as\\nthough they had suddenly fallen asleep. I deem, however, that it was not\\nall for fear, but somewhat for courtesy. But now let him to whom all\\ndefer undertake the wight.'],\n",

The feature will roll out to users globally in the “coming weeks,” the company says. (How it will work at launch is up for debate: some users were reporting being routed to gas stations instead of EV chargers.)\\n\\nWaze briefly trialed adding EV chargers to its route planning tool back in 2021 in partnership with Volkswagen. But that trial only lasted a few weeks, and after it concluded, the charging stations vanished from the app. With today’s announcement, Waze has added EV charging “permanently” to the app, a company spokesperson said.\\n\\nWaze also claims that thanks to its crowdsourced map editing function, “EV data is reviewed and updated in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.”\\n\\n“Charging station information is often inconsistent, outdated or unreliable, creating a major pain point for EV drivers who may navigate to a charging station only to discover they can’t find it or use it,” Waze says in a blog post. “By adding up-to-date EV charging information to the Waze map, it’s even easier to charge your car and get help finding where or when you’ll come across the next station.”\\n\\nWaze is not the only navigation app trying to improve the experience of finding a working EV charger. Google, which owns Waze, has been tweaking its own flagship app, Google Maps, including information about the types of plugs present at certain charging stations and whether those plugs are currently in use. The company also recently upgraded EV charging searches for electric vehicles with Google built-in software.\\n\\nThere is a host of EV charging navigation tools, from A Better Route Planner to PlugShare to Chargeway. All have their upsides and downsides.

The map app is rolling out new data beginning today that now includes EV charger location information, which it will use to help EV drivers plan routes.\\n\\nThe new app feature will let you specify your EV type and the relevant charging plug, which you can use to filter just the appropriate charging stations. Waze says that its community will review and update the map data \"in real-time to provide the most accurate, comprehensive information to the map.\"\\n\\nWaze\\'s addition of EV charger location data now gives EV drivers yet another route-planning tool. Apps like PlugShare and A Better Route Planner are both widely used by EV drivers to find chargers, and both Apple Maps and Google Maps have EV-routing features now as well.\\n\\nAnd as EV drivers already know, it\\'s common practice for all but the barest-bones EV to feature charger locations in their onboard navigation system. In fact, it can be preferable to use that option rather than casting from one\\'s phone, as many EVs will precondition the battery for faster charging if the native navigation app has a charger set as the destination.\\n\\nWaze will begin rolling out the EV data from today, although it says it will do so globally \"over the coming weeks.\"',\n",
       "  \"Can you summarize the main topics that were discussed at the Moose Lake City Council Meeting on April 8th, including the approval of a donation for the Post Prom Committee, concerns about tax increment financing and the construction of new apartments, and updates on upcoming projects such as the electrical line work, Opportunity Park, and wastewater treatment facility upgrades? Answer according to: Julie Nelson and Nancy Hedin of the Moose Lake Post Prom Committee requested a donation from the Moose Lake City Council at its meeting Wednesday, April 8. The council members approved a $300 donation from the newly-formed contribution fund approved earlier this year. This is the first donation from the fund, which receives funding from pull-tabs at the Moose Lake Municipal Liquor Store. This year's outing will be held at Mont du Lac Chalet in the east Duluth area. Dave Johnson, during the public comment section of the meeting, spoke about his concerns regarding tax increment financing and the possible construction of new apartments in Moose Lake. He expressed concerns that what the city needs is more jobs, not tax increment financing for new apartments. He stated concerns that taxes on his Lake Shore Manor apartments and the Paul Rouche apartments have risen dramatically. He said he has no concern with conventional buildings going up without tax increment financing, but wants to see businesses that will offer jobs in the city. Rich Maxfield, superintendent of Moose Lake Power and Light, spoke to the council regarding the upcoming electrical line work that will be done in Moose Lake. The power lines that run from Douglas Avenue to Birch Avenue, between 3rd Street and 5th Street will be removed and replaced with underground lines. A transformer box will be located on 4th Street just west of Birch. Pedestals will be placed on 4th and 5th, with one pedestal servicing two homes. The pedestals will be placed on the property line near the street. The underground wiring will be pulled through electrical piping and will not disturb the property located at these sites. Brian Weidenforf of Land and Lease, developer of Moose Lake's Opportunity Park, spoke with the council regarding wetland credits and water/sewer piping. Weidendorf has been meeting with Carlton County regarding a wetland credits purchase, instead of Moose Lake wetland credits. However, he is able to use 8-inch ductile iron pipe (DIP) that Moose Lake has in storage. Weidendorf, City Administrator Pat Oman and the council are negotiating the costs of streetlights for the Opportunity Park project. The city wants decorative streetlights to match Arrowhead Lane. Weidendorf is willing to pay for regular street lighting, if the city is willing to pay the extra cost for special street lighting. Discussions will continue. A discussion was held regarding a letter received from Kwik Trip regarding the convenience store it is planning to construct at Opportunity Park. The letter addresses the planned construction of a storm water pond for the proposed site. There will be certain storm water features that will be incorporated into the site by Kwik Trip, to provide proper handling of storm water. A new pipe outfall will be constructed that will carry the majority of the storm water from the site. A sump catch basin manhole equipped with a SNOUT oil/water separator will be used for storm water draining from the fueling areas to provide pretreatment of storm water prior to discharging to the pond. A meeting regarding rural aging was held on March 26 at the home of Rita Baresh to discuss issues facing the elderly in the city of Moose Lake. Transportation was listed as one of the top priorities. A White House listening session is set for Thursday, May 14 from 2:30-5 p.m. at the depot community center. It will be a listening session and people can come, give their input, and then leave. Catherine Sampson of the Arrowhead Area Agency on Aging is setting up the session. Mayor Ted Shaw attended the meeting and brought the information to the council. Council members discussed transportation for the elderly and the feasibility of a bus system within Moose Lake. This has been done previously, but was stopped in 2008 because there was only one person using the service. The council will discuss this idea further at its next meeting. Joe Rhein, city engineer, and Brian Guldan, environment project engineer, spoke regarding the wastewater treatment facility upgrades. The city had previously approved upgrades to the current system. However, Guldan spoke to the council regarding the addition of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) to the wastewater facility treatment project. SCADA consists of hardware, software and communication systems that can control, monitor and log data for the lift stations and various other types of processes in the water and wastewater treatment facility. Maxfield stated SCADA was used in Wilmar with excellent results. City personnel can access the data from smart phones or tablets to determine what needs to be done, and program the changes that need to be made from their phone or tablet. SCADA will save approximately 1.5 man-hours every day. The system was approved by the council. The council also approved the addition of a stand-alone, diesel-powered backup generator for the new lift stations. The generator would prevent any backup of sewage during power outages in the community. Approval was given for the purchase and installation of diaper changing stations in the men’s and women’s bathrooms in the public area by the library in the city building. The next regular meeting of the Moose Lake City Council will be held on Wednesday, May 13 at 6:30 p.m. in the city council chamber.\",\n",

       " 10: [\"what's up today I'm going to show you how to make a more delicious more in balance and slightly fancier version of a sloppy joe think of it as a sloppy joe with its shirt tucked in or a sloppy Joseph let's call it that to get started I need to experience the standard issue cafeteria sloppy joe to see if it's as bad as I remember for that I've got a good old-fashioned can of Manwich here by the way Manwich is a sick name for a product but looking at this ingredient label I'm not super excited to try it two out of the first four ingredients are high fructose corn syrup and plain corn syrup straight out of the can though it actually doesn't taste that bad it's kind of like if you added ketchup to Taco Bell mild sauce now to make it sloppy I'll follow the four step instructions on the can step one is cook beef thoroughly for that I'll just Brown off a pound of ground beef in a non-stick pan then step two add Manwich sauce now the can doesn't say to do this but I cooked this sauce down a little bit so that it wasn't so soupy and then step three is to ask to be called Chef by everyone who addresses you that's awesome I assume it's because your sloppy joes are just going to be so freaking sick that they have no choice and then step four is to serve dig in and leave hunger behind oh I got it this tastes like an overly ketchup hamburger from McDonald's just kind of uh Bland ground beef with tons of corn syrup and tomato product yum honestly it's a pretty low bar so of course we can do better to get started I'll need one pound of ground beef I prefer to use 80 20 here because leaner meat would not be unctuous enough next I'll drop my meat into a bowl and then add one gram or a quarter teaspoon of baking soda this soda is going to help inhibit the beef proteins from bonding together while they cook making the beef nice and tender one of my main gripes with sloppy joes is that the meat tends to be tough and gristly and it gets stuck in your teeth also if you're wondering if more soda here would make the beef more tender I tried that and made this recipe with 4 grams instead of one and Not only was this version borderline mushy the extra soda raised the pH in the sauce so much that it caramelized a lot more than it should have and it had a really weird unwelcome dark flavor to it moral the story is some soda good a lot of soda bad and very weird now I'm gonna let this beef sit for a second while I bust out some quick knife work for that I've got one onion and one poblano pepper for the onion I'm gonna go with a small ish dice here too big and the onions won't melt into the sauce and they'll Stand Out texture really in a way that I don't like in total I'll need 150 grams of onion for the papano I'll also go with a pretty small dice here and I'm using it over a more traditional green bell pepper because it brings some mellow heat and has a lot more green chili flavor I'll need 100 grams of poblano once I've got my veggies diced I'll grab a large non-stick pan and drop it on the stove over medium-high heat and once that's hot I'll add in a good long squeezer of olive oil and then in goes my onions my poblanos and then a strong pinch of salt from there I'll jump in and Fry these two together to soften them up a little bit and to get some color going around the edges that'll take about three to four minutes with pretty frequent stirring and once the aromatics are softened up and starting to take on some color I'll add in my soded beef from there I'll jump back in with my ground meat musher to spread it out and break it down by the way this musher is one of only two or three single purpose tools that I keep in my tool drawer in my opinion it doesn't much much better job at crumbling meat down than a spatula or a potato masher and it's very worth the five dollars it cost now I'll continue to smush this meat for two to three minutes or however long it takes to break it down into very small particles smaller ground beef particles not only have more surface area to catch that flavorful sloppy joe sauce but they're also better to eat and after about four minutes this meat is starting to take on some nice Browning it's cooked through and most importantly we've got it crumbled down into an edible size so next comes some seasoning in goes five grams of salt 5 grams of onion powder 5 grams of garlic powder 2 grams of black pepper 5 grams of paprika and then a strong pinch of chili flakes next I'll give that a toss to combine and then fry the spices with the meat and veggies to open up their flavors that'll take about 30 seconds or so and once I'm there I'll add in 10 grams of all-purpose flour and then stir that in this flour is going to help thicken the sauce a little bit and also help emulsify the beef fat later on so our Josephs won't be overly greasy and once the flour is stirred in enough to hydrate it and the raw flavor has been cooked off I'll add in my wet ingredients that's going to be 50 grams of tomato paste 50 grams of ketchup 15 grams of yellow mustard 15 grams of brown sugar 50 grams of worch or as I like to call it were chest ER sure Worcestershire call it whatever you want but in my opinion sloppy Josephs are just as much about worch as they are about the ketchup so I use a lot next I'll add in 20 grams of red wine vinegar and then this won't be surprising I'm gonna add in a little bit of better than bouillon beef paste about 10 grams lastly I'll add in 350 grams of any kind of store-bought stock and then I'll jump in and stir to get everything combined and once we're looking Saucy I'll bring this sauce up to a simmer reduce the heat to medium low and then think made in the sponsor of this video for making such a dope non-stick pan if you haven't heard of Maiden they're a cookware brand that partners with multi-generational factories and Artisans to help bring you a curated collection of materials and shapes that you need in your kitchen over the last year I've switched most of my cookware over to maiden and that's not just because they're a sponsor and I got some of it for free I mean that part was nice but I like the first few pieces that I got so much that I went out and spent some of my own money on a few more maiden's professional quality products are made for the home cook but their kitchenware is all also used in multiple Michelin starred restaurants because it's professional quality this 12-inch non-stick pan that I'm using in this video and all of maiden's non-stick products use the same composition of their five-ply stainless steel line that I love the non-stick surface is double cured made without pfoa it's non-toxic it's super easy to clean and bonus its oven safe up to 500 f plus it's held up really well for me which is amazing because I'm super hard on my cookware check out maiden's non-stick cookware using the link in my description for a limited time they're offering viewers of this video 15 off their first order with my link now for about 10 minutes I'm going to reduce the cooking liquid while also coming back intermittently with my meat musher to break the beef down even further cooking the meat with wet heat kind of braises it and allows the fat inside to render more fully making it more tender combine that with the soda and we're going to have very luscious very tender beef and after about 10 to 12 minutes of reduction when I come back and push my spatula through the sauce you can see it leaves a pretty wide Gap there's there's also going to be a bunch of beef fat sitting on top and that's totally okay just give this a vigorous stir and the AP flower that we used earlier will emulsify that fat into the sauce and you guys don't under reduce this sauce either if it's too loose the meat mixture won't hold itself together and it will literally just crumble off the sandwich into a pile on your plate that's too sloppy now the last step is to taste for salt levels and I think we got it babe let's try it real good now to make this into a sandwich I'll drop a non-stick pan over medium heat from there I'll brush a liberal amount of melted butter on the inside of a squishy store-bought brioche bun these little brioche joints are widely available and exceptionally soft way better for this sandwich in my opinion than those stale dry quote hamburger buns not for my burger bro next I'll pop my buttered bun in the pan and then give it a light toast on both sides this is going to bring some much needed crispiness to a sandwich that is normally just pure soft and once I've caught a little crisp around the edges like this I'll pull it out next I'll drop four to six ounces of my meat mixture and then I'll attempt to mitigate slop here by tidying the meat a little bit my hope is that piling it tall and tight will keep most of it on the bun and off of my wrist slash plate and there we go a not so sloppy sloppy joe oop I'll just tuck that in a little bit I'm in control here Joe or should I say Joseph wow you've really matured it used to be a total mess of a sandwich but now your beefy Savory a little bit spicy a little bit sweet and perfectly in Balance textually this sandwich is so different from the Joe's of your pass it's tender and juicy isn't the right word but I'll say pleasantly moist it's just a deluxe version of an otherwise very unglamorous sandwich and it's so much more flavorful than I expected let's eat this thing [Music] thank you\",\n",
       "  \"I made two types of gluten-free low-carb pancakes and took them to the streets to see if people could tell the difference between these two recipes and regular pancakes made with all-purpose flour would you like to try some pancakes if you're keto it can be a struggle to find a pancake recipe that doesn't taste like an egg coconut flour or cardboard but I think I found two recipes that can stand up to the tried and true pancake let's see who comes out on top first I'm making my coconut flour pancakes that have almost a five-star perfect review on my website ketofocus.com but don't let the words coconut flour scare you I know some people don't like the flavor of coconut flour but I have some tips to help diminish that flavor in these pancakes I found that adding 8 ounces of softened cream cheese helps to neutralize that strong coconut flavor but it also helps neutralize the egg flavor since we're adding four eggs to this recipe why so many well that's what's going to help puff up our pancake since we're not using flour with gluten we have to add more eggs then add in a half a cup of coconut flour and I do believe that the brand of coconut flour matters when it comes to lessening that coconut flavor my favorite brands of coconut flour is the one from Thrive market and also Anthony's coconut flour then add in a quarter cup of sugar-free sweetener and half a cup of heavy cream or nut milk and for a leavening agent add two teaspoons of baking powder then one teaspoon of vanilla extract for flavor using a blender helps to get this batter smooth and make sure that all that cream cheese is broken up but you don't want to over blend it or else you're not going to be left with puffy pancakes instead you may want to mix all your ingredients first and then add the eggs at the end but I didn't do that here when it comes to cooking these pancakes I recommend a non-stick electric griddle over Skillet because the heat is more evenly distributed since this batter is thick you only want to add enough to make a three inch pancake and cook it slowly over low heat low heat that's the key this will give it time to cook without burning the bottom have patience because it's going to take around four to six minutes on the first side you know it's ready to flip when you can easily slide a spatula underneath the pancake drag it and then flip if you feel it getting stuck like I did with this pancake in fact I felt it tear I wasn't patient and now I have to pay the price with a pancake that's not not pretty let these cook for a few more minutes on this side until they're cooked through I think these pancakes have incredible flavor and I don't taste the coconut flour but let's see what other people think before I show you the next pancake recipe let's talk about my sponsor for today's video and not the fact that I'm wearing completely different clothes my sponsor for today's video is element electrolytes when you wake up in the morning chances are you're dehydrated because no one drinks water and sleeps at the same time I think that's like physically impossible it's called drowning probably to rehydrate so that I can have the most energy to start my day out right I have a glass of element electrolytes these electrolytes contain a science-backed electrolyte mix of a thousand milligrams of sodium 200 milligrams of potassium and 60 milligrams of magnesium sounds like a lot of electrolytes right but you actually need that many especially if you follow a low carb diet because a lot of those electrolytes are fleshed out right now element is offering my viewers a free sample pack with any order that's eight single serving packets free with any element order it's a really good way so you can try all eight flavors all you have to do is go to drinkelement.com ketofocus this deal is only available through my link so go to drinkelement.com keto Focus right after I show you how to make another amazing keto pancake recipe now let's change outfits again instead of coconut flour another low carb gluten-free flour that's used is almond flour the problem with almond flour is that it can burn easily which is why I didn't use it in this blender pancake recipe that I just showed you because they have to cook for a long time on one side just increases the risk that your pancakes are going to burn with a few simple ingredients you probably already have on hand you can make a fat sack of fluffy pancakes with little effort start with your dry ingredients mix one and a third cup of almond flour make sure you use blanched super fine almond flour then add one teaspoon of baking powder and a half a teaspoon of salt mix together then add a quarter cup of heavy cream or nut milk two eggs a tablespoon of sweetener a teaspoon of vanilla and since I used heavy cream I found that my batter was a little bit too thick so I'm sending it out with a couple tablespoons of nut milk you shouldn't have to do this if you use nut milk from the beginning since it does have a thinner consistency and to keep our pancakes from being too dry I'm adding in one tablespoon of melted butter plus it gives our pancakes this buttery finish the consistency of this batter is more like regular pancake batter scoop onto a preheated griddle over low medium heat and let these cook for a few minutes on each side until golden brown now it's time for our blind taste test these two are going up against Kodiak pancake mix because that's really all I had in my pantry which pancake is made with flour they look really good I don't know it's kind of hard to tell this pancake is made with regular flour nope that's the pancake made with almond flour can you make one of these for breakfast I'm tired of bacon and eggs if you were to click right here for more ideas that aren't bacon and eggs\",\n",
       "  \"- Today I'm gonna show you how to make an incredible chickpea curry. Chickpeas are coated in a generous blend of spices and aromatics, simmered until creamy, and finished with greens and fresh herbs. We're gonna get started with the aromatics. (tray clattering) Wow, that was heavy. (film reel beeping) We'll finely dice a large onion, doesn't matter if it's yellow or red.\\n\\n We're also gonna mince up six garlic cloves, and take a knob of ginger, about two inches. Grate that up. And dice a Serrano pepper, or two, or three. This is where you can really moderate the heat of this curry.\\n\\nIf you tend towards the baby mouth side of the spectrum, go ahead and use one.\\n\\n And if you're off the scale, like a baby, baby mouth, maybe take out the membranes from these. They will get moderated in the curry so it's not gonna be super spicy. Try not to just directly inhale it like I did just now. What I do recommend is immediately going to wash your hands. Soap it up.\\n\\n We are left with the task of putting this into our bowl and I have just washed my hands. I feel like I have done this before and yet I have not learned my lesson, but that's why I'm here. So you can learn my lessons and not repeat them. I don't think I mentioned this yet but this is an Indian chickpea curry. So these four ingredients, the onions, ginger, garlic, green chilies are what I call the holy quaternity of Indian cooking.\\n\\n They create the flavor base for so many amazing Indian recipes, and that's how my mom taught me how to make my recipes. And moms are never wrong. And if you're wondering, are we making a chana masala, Nisha? No, we are not.\\n\\nAlthough I do love that.\\n\\n This is more of a creamy version with greens, some different spices and it's pretty quick to make. We also need two Roma tomatoes. I'm pretty impressed I caught that. This is about one half pound or eight ounces of tomatoes. I like to cut the tomatoes pretty finely so they melt into the curry.\\n\\n And if tomatoes are truly horrible where you live right now because it's winter, you can use half of a 14 ounce can of diced or crushed tomatoes. (water spraying) And because this is an Indian curry, we of course needs some spices. I've got my Indian masala dabba here, and the two whole spices we're gonna use today are cumin seeds and coriander seeds. Want a heaping teaspoon of the cumin seeds and two teaspoons of the coriander seeds. I'm also gonna use some curry leaves in this recipe.\\n\\n So if you're thinking, I don't have those, I'm not gonna make this recipe, bye, stay 'cause they're optional.\\n\\nBut if you have an Indian grocery store, I highly recommend seeking fresh curry leaves out. They are low-key a superstar ingredient. Not low-key for Indian people 'cause we already know they're amazing, but low-key for everybody else who might not be familiar with them. Smells so good.\\n\\n For this recipe, I'm gonna use maybe 15 fresh curry leaves. They obviously vary in size, so if yours are really large, you can use less. And if they're really small, you can use more. And for our ground spices, we're using some pretty common spices that you should have at home, or easy to find at any grocery store. A teaspoon of ground coriander.\\n\\n A teaspoon and a half of curry powder. A half teaspoon of ground cinnamon. Quarter teaspoon of turmeric.\\n\\nAnd a half teaspoon of freshly graded nutmeg. (grater scraping) Everything that needs to be prepped is ready.\\n\\n So I'm gonna grab my tiny stove and get to cooking. Medium high heat. Pro tip, if you have a stainless steel pan and you feel like the food sticks too much, let the pan heat up dry for a minute and a half or two. Then add your oil and let that heat up for a little bit and your food will stick a lot less. We're gonna add two tablespoons of oil.\\n\\n This is avocado oil. And we'll add in our cumin and coriander seeds. What we're doing is toasting our spices in oil. This is called blooming. And the reason I like to do this is because spices are fat soluble.\\n\\n So you're gonna unlock lots of hidden aromas and flavors when you toast them in a fat source. This shouldn't take long. You just wanna get them a few shades darker and it'll smell really aromatic.\\n\\nNow for our curry leaves, if you're using fresh, have your lid handy 'cause these will sputter up. (pan sizzling) That's because there's a lot of moisture in the leaves so they're interacting with the hot oil.\\n\\n And this really only needs like 20 seconds, so don't do it for too long. (pan sizzling) If you're using dried curry leaves, this will not happen. So don't worry. Now we're gonna add in our onions, hit them with a little salt, and show you what it looks like so far. Because we diced those onions pretty finely, they won't take too long to get some color on them.\\n\\n Maybe five minutes. If you feel like things are starting to get a little toasty, maybe too toasty, add a splash of water to the glaze. (pan sizzling) Time for our other aromatics.\\n\\nThe jar, jarlic. (giggling) (film reel beeping) The garlic, ginger, and green chilies.\\n\\n Oh, this is when the Serrano peppers are activated. You'll know. Your nostrils and your throat pipe, you'll know. I don't know what the medical term is for a throat pipe. Larynx?\\n\\n (film reel beeping) Now we are ready to add tomato paste, two tablespoons of this, and those ground spices. You wanna stir vigorously now, otherwise the spices will burn. (coughing) This is where you might sneeze a little bit. And we have some stuff sticking to the bottom, so let's add in our water.\\n\\nYou wanna stir this pretty vigorously for maybe 90 seconds 'cause now we're gonna add in our tomatoes.\\n\\n Tomatoes need about five minutes. So in the meantime, I'm gonna drain our chickpeas. (upbeat music) And this is pretty much a perfect recipe to me. It's got so much flavor, it's relatively easy to make. It's got protein, fat, fiber, even greens.\\n\\n Honestly, the only thing that would make it even more perfect is if it were a 30 minute meal.\\n\\nBut good Indian food requires this layering of flavors and you can't rush that process. You can't just dump some curry powder into a soup pot and call it a curry. I'm sure you've seen those recipes online. We're not doing that.\\n\\n We wanna build an actually super flavorful, delicious curry. So once it's nicely softened like this, that's when you add the rest of the ingredients. Chickpeas, just toss to coat.\\n\\nI'm just using canned chickpeas today 'cause I wanna keep things relatively quick. But if you're the kind of person who makes their own beans from scratch, more power to you.\\n\\n This will be even more delicious. Now we're gonna add our coconut milk. This is what makes this curry creamy and velvety. Wow, it is so beautiful already, I have to show you. Woo.\\n\\n We're also gonna add a very untraditional ingredient. Tahini, what the heck is this Middle Eastern sesame paste doing in my Indian curry? It's gonna add an additional layer of richness and a subtle nuttiness, but you're not gonna taste tahini. It's just gonna be this kind of subtly hidden ingredient. And this is similar to my red lentil curry that I know a lot of you love, where I use almond butter.\\n\\nAgain, you don't taste the almond butter, but it does add that noticeable richness. And a half cup of water so it's not too thick. Once she's simmering, you're gonna cover it and simmer for 15 to 20 ish minutes. I forgot an important step, salt. I was supposed to add it with the tomatoes.\\n\\n I didn't. We're gonna add it now. And black pepper. It's going to activate the curcumin in the turmeric. Stir that in.\\n\\n (lid clattering) Oh, also, one more thing. Sugar, just a tiny bit to balance everything out. You can use any sugar. I'm using coconut sugar today and just a half teaspoon. Normally I would've added the sugar with the coconut milk.\\n\\nAll right, while this simmers, we're gonna do a few things. First, we're gonna make some rice to serve with the curry. I like using my instant pot for this because it is very hands-off. (upbeat music) As I mentioned, we've got some greens in this curry. I am using Swiss chard today.\\n\\n It is one of those vegetables that's so good for you that I kind of forget to eat most of the time. So this is a great way to get it into your diet, get it into your kids' diets, get it into your picky partners' diets.\\n\\nI'm pointing over here 'cause my picky partner Max is behind the camera over there. First we're gonna wash it and then we'll finely chop it up. You can make this curry with any greens.\\n\\n So if you wanna skip the chard, you can use kale. You can use pre-bagged baby spinach or baby kale too. We've got some fresh herbs, cilantro and mint. And these will be used as a finishing ingredient. I'm not measuring these, but I'd say a large handful of each.\\n\\n And if you only have one or the other herb, that's totally fine too. (chopping) All right, it's been about 20 minutes. I'm gonna add in our greens. The greens need to simmer for about five minutes. If you're using something more tender like baby spinach, it probably just needs a minute or two.\\n\\n Last couple things. We're gonna add two teaspoons of garam masala once the greens have wilted. Garam masala is often used as a finishing spice like this, and it adds this incredible, bold, slightly sweet, warm flavor.\\n\\nI usually like to add a little more salt now because once you add the greens, they start to draw out some of the salt that's already in there. Little bit of lemon juice to brighten everything.\\n\\n And our cilantro and mint. Yum, this looks so good. Wow. I can't tell you how good it smells. When I was growing up, people used to make fun of me 'cause my house smelled like curry.\\n\\n And honestly, now I'm just like, y'all are stupid. Curry smells delicious. And you would be so lucky if your house could smell like it. I wanna live in this. Time for a taste test.\\n\\n Would you look at this? It's so beautiful.\\n\\nIt's creamy. It's got that nice green color from the herbs and the greens. (upbeat music) It's warming, it's comforting, it's creamy.\\n\\n It's got a little freshness from the mint. And if you want even more delicious vegan Indian recipes, I've got a short playlist for you right here. Bye-bye. Tomatoes..\"],\n",

       "  'Title: \"Sony FX30 - The Nostalgic Film Look (My Color Grading Workflow) - YouTube\"\\nVideo Transcript: \"so I\\'ve been taking the fx30 with me everywhere to test out its fullest potential I\\'ve taken it to Korea Taiwan and Mexico to capture memories and also used it on Commercial work as well and surprisingly this camera can do 99 of what the fx3 can do at least from a use case you get better low light on the fx3 but other than that the fx30 still competes pretty hard with the fx3 the potential coming out of this camera is just amazing for its price so today I want to share how I color grade and how you can make the footage look beautiful coming from the fx30 [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign happy 2023 to everyone my name is Victor and today we\\'re going to go through how I color grade my fx30 footage and first we\\'re going to go through all the settings and that is the h265 format internally which is the xavc HS the reason why I use the HS format is because one it is a mix of Both Worlds of the S and the s i meaning that it is compressed and also it gives you a better quality image in terms of the recording format from your camera now one of the biggest requirements for this is to have an editing machine that has an h.265 accelerator that means it\\'s a media encoder and decoder so that it really processes it fast on your editing machine and specifically what I use is an M1 Pro base model 16 inch MacBook Pro and I have a 16 gig RAM and that\\'s all that I need if you don\\'t have a machine that has a media accelerator for h.264 or h.265 I suggest using the SI format because it\\'s going to give you the most uncompressed footage from your camera but that means that it\\'s going to give you larger file size but it also is easier on your editing machine because your machine doesn\\'t need to always decode and encode the files while you\\'re editing now let\\'s talk about exposure for the fx30 and the fx3 I use cine EI mode on EI 400 on the base ISO 800 90 of the time night time and daytime I usually leave it at zero on the metering so that I have a good range on the shadows and also a good range on the highlights now if you\\'re using an a74 or something that doesn\\'t have a cine EI shooting mode or if you just want to use flexible ISO mode that\\'s just sticking to the base isos of your camera on slog3 and for my cameras the fx30 and the a74 that is 800 base ISO and then for the fx30 2500 it is the second base ISO and for the a74 is 3200 second base ISO just going to give you a better dynamic range doesn\\'t necessarily mean that it\\'s going to get rid of all the noise but it would have the cleanest image from both of those base isos and in terms of metering I usually just expose it from 0 to plus one and then I get similar results with the cine EI mode that\\'s everything you need to know before you get into color grading really nailing the settings and the exposure first before you push your color grade is a big must okay let\\'s start off with footage from Mexico this is the Cenote scene it\\'s going to look like this in the beginning you don\\'t have anything we\\'re going to turn off the effects and we\\'re gonna do the clip here so that we have more real estate for the video okay so I\\'m gonna apply my VL workflow right here so that my node structures are here and node structure is similar to the layer structure it\\'s just a little different than layers I like the nose structure better but if you\\'re editing in Premiere Pro or Final Cut you might have to work with layers and kind of understand just how you arrange everything so this is the bottom and this is all the way to the top okay on here let\\'s start with the CSD I\\'m gonna use my own personal Lut which is the film Lut you don\\'t need to use my Luts you can use CSD in here let me guys show you the freeway of utilizing this one you go CST and then we\\'re gonna look for Sony s-log S gamut three dot cine and then the s-log 3 and then what we\\'re going to do is output color space as Rec 709 and same thing with this one Rec 709 and we\\'re just going to turn this on perfect and this is kind of like how you would normally do it and if you\\'ve shot everything on s stock 3 you can actually just disable this or delete that node and go to Project settings and once you go to Project settings you go to input lookup table and then we\\'re gonna find s-log 3 S gamma 3. cine2lc minus 709 and it\\'s pretty much going to be the same thing and it\\'s just going to apply it to all of your footage instead of you manually doing it on every footage so since I\\'ve developed my own Luts I\\'m going to use it because I love using my Luts I developed it for my style and that we\\'re going to use it all throughout in this tutorial and you also have the free version or whatever conversion Luts that you want to use in your videos so let\\'s get started this is the my conversion Lut and I\\'m just going to add maybe two points of green that\\'s a little bit too much so I\\'m gonna go with 26 and a touch because in the Cenote what happened is that there\\'s a lot of greens reflecting through these Mossy rocks and the trees as well so the skin tones is gonna get affected on that and we\\'re gonna isolate that a little bit later okay so first things first we\\'re gonna balance the image meaning that we want to really neutralize the colors and make sure that it\\'s neutral as possible so that we can really push the looks so in this case I don\\'t really have any reference in terms of whites or blacks what we can do is kind of just neutralize the blacks and maybe the whites on here so it\\'s not having any color cast on the neutral tones so we know we\\'re balanced what we\\'re going to do is we\\'re going to neutralize the whites on my hair and the blacks on my hair because this is the only reference point that I have right click and then you\\'re gonna go show picker RGB value and we\\'re just gonna go to qualifier so you can see the value before I\\'m just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we\\'re just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we\\'re almost all even so I\\'m just gonna leave it at that again we don\\'t have a card here this is a travel video so we\\'re just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tools that we have in DaVinci okay so now I\\'m gonna try and see if I\\'m missing anything on the white values you can see the value before I\\'m just going to get an average of what color is missing so far I think we are losing a little bit of red so we\\'re just going to add a touch to see if it all balances out 6A 10 11 we\\'re almost all even so I\\'m just gonna leave it at that again we don\\'t have a card here this is a travel video so we\\'re just gonna eyeball it as best as we can with the tool Vector scope we can see that it\\'s almost at the skin tone line the reason why I\\'m leaving it first because I want to see how it looks later my skin tone is a little bit reddish and it falls under this line it\\'s not directly on this line because it\\'s going to get us somewhere like uh if we touch this it\\'s gonna give me like really reddish skin tones and that\\'s not my skin tone my skin tone is a little just under it now I want to adjust the exposure for this one so let\\'s go back to waveform so what it does is that it just sucks out a little bit of the color with the little neutral tones and that we\\'re bringing everything back uh that\\'s too much and that we\\'re bringing everything back so what happens here is that the color boost really just decreases the value of the saturation on each level in in numerical form and then saturation we\\'re increasing that by 15 it\\'s more like a multiplier and as you can see here the blacks and the neutral tones are a little bit more neutral and that it\\'s a little bit more even especially for my light a little bit if you can see here the Cenote has really nice God Rays coming in and with this one is a little flat so we\\'re going to shape that in post with a vignette and we\\'re gonna create a new power window and we\\'re just gonna kind of create a god Ray focusing on the subject and then we\\'re gonna hit invert and we\\'re just going to squeeze this down a little bit and you see how exaggerated it is so what we\\'re going to do is a little bit darker kind of like this and then we\\'re gonna soften it the print and then we\\'re gonna do Kodak two three A3 enable that and it\\'s a little bit weird right now that\\'s why we started with the PFE adjust we\\'re gonna try to find the Black Point we\\'re gonna enable this where it looks natural and then the white Point as well where it looks natural you can see that it adds a lot of contrast so we\\'re gonna try and reduce that tonal contrast and then the target white is the white balance that you started with so we had a little warmer tone so we\\'re add a little bit of blue in the shadows um perfect and then some green cast to it awesome and then from the PFE adjust what happens if you do the print film emulation the Kodak 2383 we can increase the saturation because it sucks it out perfect that\\'s good so now without the PFE it looks like this it looks normal but with the PFE is a little more stylized now the problem with this one is the skin tones it\\'s too orange we\\'re gonna go back to the skin node and what we\\'re gonna do is go back to Vector scope you can see that it\\'s a clean white we\\'re gonna add [Music] I\\'m gonna do the radius maybe grow no we\\'re gonna shrink it and then we\\'re just gonna keep blurring it so that the edges are softer and then the noise for sure what I do is that we\\'re just gonna magic mask everything but now it\\'s gonna follow the subject great okay now now what we can do here is that bringing everything back and that looks perfect now I can see that it\\'s just right below the skin tone line and if we push it to the skin tone line I just become more bit so uh what we can do is that we\\'re gonna copy this and then create a new node and then this is going to be halation and then paste it there we\\'re gonna enable the bloom and then we\\'re gonna enable the halation on this one so that the bloom affects all the entirety of the image and then this is just Asian and what we\\'re going to do is we\\'re going to create a mask to the subject right here and then soft right there invert so everything gets halation but my skin tones and then we\\'re gonna track it as well and we\\'re done this is our look right here okay so next up we\\'re gonna match this to the other Cenote footage we\\'re gonna do is grab a still right here and then we just drag this we\\'re gonna disable the skin and also delete the power grade for the halation this is a little bit too much on the halation so what we\\'re gonna do is we are just gonna bring it down a tad and then I do want the bloom to be a little bit dreamier so we\\'re just going to really push that so the trees is a little bit something I\\'m just showing you guys how I step by step do this and we are going to go to Hue versus uh U versus saturation and we\\'re gonna get that red color and we\\'re just going to increase the saturation so it bumps up so it pops a little bit more because without it it\\'s looking a little dull and with it now we have some leading lines and contrasting to the blue and the green as well okay so now what we can do is grab this still because we\\'re going to do the same thing with this shot and as you can see shots now we\\'re gonna move on to the nighttime shots in Taiwan and let me show you guys how to quickly grade this and we\\'re just gonna go on to my power grade again via workflow and this is quite easy so let\\'s go to CST what we\\'re going to do is we\\'re going to do add the film let and then add the green tint to it perfect now as you can see that the highlights and the Shadows are a little bit crushed so we\\'re going to go to the adjust we\\'re going to ignore everything else we\\'re going to quickly grade this couldn\\'t retain anything for those lights so since it\\'s low light we do want it to be dark but the Shadows are now crushed we\\'re going to lift it up just a tiny bit so that we get a little bit more footage on there and then and then now we can add a little bit more green and then we\\'re gonna go to the look which we\\'re gonna add some blue tones to it or some green tones to the Shadows teal or green doesn\\'t matter and then the gamma to a little cooler tone to the blue side that\\'s a little too much actually because I love that profile and then we\\'re gonna reset the sharpen to just adjust and then what we\\'re gonna do is enable PFE kodak2383 print film and we\\'re just going to adjust the colors and then from me here on we\\'re just going to adjust the white balance to maybe a cooler tone and now this is kind of a true orange and teal look low light footage and we\\'re just going to adjust the highlights again and the Shadows so that we retain the information with here because before we had the information on there but with did something to the highlights we\\'re gonna adjust it again a little bit lower perfect and then maybe a darker Vibe with everything last but not least the film grain I love film grain and that we\\'re gonna add this Shadows all under 30. and we\\'re done this is the final look and then we\\'re just going to copy everything again to the other footage right here this is actually almost done just gotta lift up the blacks a little bit and this is the final look as you can see the computer can\\'t handle the answer orange and teal or kind of just green Subway look into this video uh it\\'s a little saturated in my taste and her skin tone is actually closer to Yellow and what we\\'re gonna do is gonna go use saturation give it just a negative value on there and then there you go we\\'re looking at a super green cast and then apply the skin adjustment we\\'re looking at normal skin tones again with a little green cast to it so I find it looks good what it is and then we\\'re just gonna do the same here we\\'re gonna change the adjust because you learned something new and that if you do have any questions about anything that we went through today feel free to comment down below and we\\'re bringing it back I\\'m giving away my slot 3 Lut pack and all y\"\\nVideo Summary:',\n",

       "  \"Q: Lucas wants to get a dog but his parents think he already has too many pets and won't have enough space. He already has 12 pet beds in his room but manages to fit another 8 pet beds. His parents argue that each pet is going to need 2 beds each to feel comfortable. According to his parent's argument, how many pets does Lucas have enough room for?\\nA: Lucas has a total of 12 existing pet beds + 8 new pet beds = 20 pet beds. So according to his parents, Lucas has enough room for 20 pet beds / 2 pet beds per pet = 10 pets. The answer is 10.\\nQuestion: There are 3 kids waiting for the swings and twice as many kids waiting for the slide. If each kid waits 2 minutes for the swings and 15 seconds for the slide, how many seconds shorter is the shorter wait?\\nAnswer: First find the total wait time for the swings in minutes: 3 kids * 2 minutes / kid = 6 minutes. Then convert that number to seconds: 6 minutes * 60 seconds / minute = 360 seconds. Then find the total number of kids waiting for the slide: 3 kids * 2 = 6 kids. Then find the total wait time for the slide: 15 seconds / kid * 6 kids = 90 seconds. Then subtract the total wait for the slide from the total wait for the swings to find the difference: 360 seconds - 90 seconds = 270 seconds. The answer is 270.\\n[Question]Betsy is sewing a quilt.

If he shared the slices of pizza with the waiter, the waiter received a fraction of 8 / 13 of the total number of slices, which totals 8 / 13 * 78 = 48 slices. Twenty less the number of slices of pizza that the waiter ate is 48 - 20 = 28. The answer is 28.\\nQuestion: Elliott drew a right-angle triangle on his book. It had a base of 4 inches, a height of 3 inches and a certain length of the hypotenuse. What was the length of the perimeter of the triangle that he drew?\\nAnswer: Since the hypotenuse of a triangle is found by the square root of the base squared plus the height squared. The square of the base of the first triangle is 4 * 4 = 16 square inches. The square of the height of the first triangle is 3 * 3 = 9 square inches. The sum of the squares of the base and the height of the first triangle is 16 + 9 = 25. The square root of the sum of the base and the height of the first triangle, which is the hypotenuse of the triangle, is √25 = 5 inches. Since the perimeter of a triangle is found by adding the sides of the triangle, the base and height of the triangle sum up to 3 + 4 = 7 inches. If you add the hypotenuse of the triangle the perimeter of the triangle becomes 7 + 5 = 12 inches. The answer is 12.\\nQ: Jose is a collector of fine wines.

       " 13: ['Read the passage below and answer the question or follow the instruction: What potential shortcomings does Small Office Security have, especially concerning mobile protection?\\n\\nPassage: Small business owners often believe their companies are immune to cybercrime. After all, why would criminals bother with guppies when they can net a whale, right? Wrong. Hackers are increasingly targeting small businesses, because they typically lack the security monitoring and management capabilities of larger companies.\\nThe problem for small business owners is consumer grade security programs aren’t robust enough to protect a business infrastructure, but most smaller companies don’t have the IT resources to manage a business-class solution.\\nBitdefender aims to bridge that gap with Small Office Security, a cloud-based suite that reduces the expense of IT maintenance and makes it easy for non-IT-professionals to manage and secure company computers.\\nOnce you subscribe to Small Office Security ($143.50 per year for up to five seats), you login to a Web-based interface called Control Center. From here, you can manage antimalware on all PCs within your network, “roaming” laptop endpoints, and remote office endpoints. Although the security suite is cloud-based, each protected system receives a local program called Endpoint Security, which can be downloaded manually to each computer or remotely deployed from within the Control Center.\\nThe main page of the Control Center features a dashboard that provides a status snapshot of your managed clients. It’s divided into four sections: Malware Activity, Malware Status, Top 10 Detected Malware, and Computer Protection Status. Each section displays a graph or a chart in varying shades of red and green to indicate how your network is faring. For example, the Malware Status section includes a pie chart that illustrates how many systems are infected, fixed, and completely clean. The Top 10 Detected Malware section features a bar graph that can help you identify if certain types of viruses are hitting your servers.\\nIn addition to the dashboard, Control Center includes six other tabs from which you can install protection and manage settings, set and apply policies, run reports, remotely manage quarantined files, and check user activity logs. Administrators have full privileges, while employees have access only to network security and user management.\\nSmall Office Security isn’t as Windows 8-ready as other suites we’ve seen. The Control Center utilizes non-touch-friendly dropdown menus, and it’s for desktops and laptops only—no mobile protection is offered through the suite. Because small businesses are especially likely to have employees using a variety of devices, including tablets and smartphones, at the office and on company time, it would have been good to see at least a nod to mobile security.\\nFor our analysis of Small Office Security’s protection capabilities, we consulted independent data from AV-Test’s December 2013 test results. The security suite received a performance score of 6 (out of 6). This indicates the software is lightweight and easy on system resources, and will run in the background virtually unnoticed. This is especially critical for small businesses, as employee productivity won’t be compromised by sluggish machines, even if you happen to be remotely tinkering around in the Control Center.\\nThe suite scored very well in AV-Test’s real-world protection tests, successfully blocking 100 percent of zero-day malware attacks (including Web threats). Although Bitdefender wasn’t included in our 2014 Security Showdown, this score puts it on par with other top security suites, including Kaspersky Internet Security 2014 and Symantec Norton Internet Security 2014 . Bitdefender also performed well on the malware zoo detection test, blocking 99 percent of widespread and prevalent malware discovered in the last four months of 2013. It didn’t flag any safe websites dangerous, and but it did falsely detect legitimate software as malware twice—slightly higher than average—during system scans.\\nBitdefender Small Office Security is designed for companies with up to 250 seats, making it an attractive choice for small business owners looking to ramp up their network security. It offers great protection and performance with an easy-to-use interface that will keep company endpoints secure with a minimum of hassle.',\n",
       "  'I recently acquired an Ouya (a microconsole running on Android) and it is an excellent little device. Out of the box, there are some great games and apps that can keep you occupied for quite a while (TowerFall anyone?). A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to do more with my Ouya console. I had a growing collection of Humble Bundle Android games that I wanted to play.\\nProbably the most annoying aspect of playing with the Ouya is getting files on to the Ouya. One of the latest updates enabled access to external storage. This means you can load files on to a thumb drive (or external hard drive) and then plug that thumb drive into the Ouya to transfer/access. The problem is I’m lazy and I don’t want to walk back and forth every time I need to transfer files.\\nIt is actually quite easy to load BitTorrent Sync on to Ouya. The device is running a modified version of Android 4.1. Below I’ll outline two methods for installing BitTorrent Sync. The first method is achieved by simply side-loading the app. Follow my instructions, and you’ll be up and running in 10 minutes. The second method involves rooting the Ouya and installing the Google Play store. This allows you to download the latest version of BitTorrent Sync for Android and keep it up to date.\\nStep 1: On your Ouya, navigate to the “discover” section and click on the “app” category. Near the top should be an app called “FilePwn”. Download that. It will come in handy.\\nStep 2: Retrieve btsync.apk from the Sync folder (see above), and place it on a thumb drive.\\nStep 3: Open FilePwn, and navigate to /usbdrive (or a similar name). You should see btsync.apk. Click on it and install it.\\nStep 4: Go back to the main Ouya menu and click on “Make”. Any apps you install that aren’t from the Ouya store will appear here. You should see an icon for BitTorrent Sync.\\nMethod 2: Root and install the Google Play Store.\\nNote: If you follow these steps exactly, everything should work. You’ll note that I have included a reboot at the end of a lot of the steps. Don’t skip this part.\\nStep 1: On your Ouya, navigate to the “discover” section and click on the “app” category. Near the top should be an app called “FilePwn. Downlaod that. It will come in handy.\\nStep 2: Load the following apps on to a thumb drive from the Sync folder (see above). Don’t bother with the btsync.apk. You will be installing from the Play Store.\\nStep 3: Using FilePwn, navigate to /usbdrive and install OUYARoot.apk. After it is installed, open it. You’ll be presented with a very simple screen that has a single button. You can’t miss it. Click on the giant button to root your device. When this is done, return to FilePwn.\\nStep 4: Install XposedInstaller.apk and open the program. After opening the program click on “Framework” and then “Install/Update”. Now Reboot (there’s a reboot button at the bottom of the screen).\\nStep 5: Open FilePwn, navigate to your thumb-drive and install ModCollection4Ouya.apk. Now open XposedInstaller again, select “modules” and check the box for the Mod Collection for Ouya. This can be a little tricky. Use the touch panel on the controller to do this. Make sure you actually see the box filled in with a blue check.\\nStep 6: For this step, you need to move the ps3ouya.zip from your thumb drive to the internal downloads folder. Open FilePwn, navigate to your thumb drive, select ps3ouya.zip and choose to move it to /storage/sdcard0/download. Open the ModCollection program and enable Google Play Store mod. Then click on “install play store”. This will only work if you have properly placed ps3ouya.zip in the download folder. Reboot.\\nStep 6: Launch the Google Play Store and enter your Google credentials. Reboot.\\nStep 7: Launch Google Play and search for “BitTorrent Sync”. Install.\\n• Make sure you use all caps when inputting a Sync key.\\n• At one point, I had an issue with the folders not syncing and I had to enable “use cellular data” in the BitTorrent Sync options. If you are having an issue with syncing, give this a shot.\\n• You may want to enable the “disable auto update” option in the ModCollection. Every auto update will disable root.\\nAaaaannnnddd done. That’s it. No more running back and forth with a thumb drive. I was able to download my Android apps from humblebundle.com (using BitTorrent!) and add them to my Sync folder. They automatically synced to my Ouya and I was able to install and play.\\nI hope you enjoy your Sync-enabled Ouya. If you need me, I’ll be playing Metal Slug 3 for the next few days. Can you provide step-by-step instructions on how to install BitTorrent Sync on an Ouya console using the first method?',\n",
       "  'Read this phone review in its entirety and then write me a blog section on the Xiaomi 13 Design Features and Build Quality:\\n\\nXiaomi 13 Full Review: The Art of Balance\\nByPaco Zheng -Dec 20, 2022\\nFacebookTwitterLinkedinReddIt\\n\\nBefore we start the unboxing, I will tell you the final conclusion right now: I love this phone. And the Xiaomi 13 Standard Edition is the most satisfying Xiaomi phone I’ve ever had. For most people, it is also the best Xiaomi phone to buy. I even think it has more appeal than the Xiaomi 12S Ultra and 13 Pro.\\n\\nIf you’re willing to listen to why I like the Xiaomi 13 so much, then I’d be happy to tell you what’s so great about it.\\nDESIGN\\nNow phones have been put in more and more stuff, the body has to be bigger and bigger. The largest regular phone has reached 7-inches, if you count the foldable phone then the number will be even like 8 inches. I often miss the old days when the phone could be controlled with one hand. When the mobile phone becomes no longer mobile, then more features also become meaningless. It’s embarrassing to think that it’s difficult to find a small-sized phone these days. It’s especially hard when you’re also trying to find a flagship small phone that doesn’t have shortcomings. I’ve put together the numbers of a few compact phones that look good right now, and blue one is their cons. It’s easy to see that the Xiaomi 13 really has no shortcomings. It’s a bigger phone than the other phones, even a little bigger than the Xiaomi 12. But it perfectly balances size and functionality. That’s the main reason why I like the Xiaomi 13: phones that are better than it, aren’t as small as it. Phones that are smaller than it, not as well as it.\\nWhy would I choose white over blue vegan leather. Look at my Xiaomi 12S Ultra that I’ve been using for less than six months. Maybe the footage isn’t visible enough. The leather texture in the four corners has been smoothed out. If you don’t want your phone to look like this, then get the glass version. Because of the small size and light weight, fingerprints are more downward, but does not affect the feel much when holding it.\\n\\nIn the unboxing video for the Xiaomi 13 series, some viewers guessed that it was still USB 2.0. Congratulations, you guessed right. This is the nightmare for Xiaomi users the whole life.\\nLike you guys, I think the Xiaomi 13 must have referenced the iPhone and Samsung. You can say the Xiaomi is copycat, but I don’t think it’s ugly, I even think it’s kind of pretty. Especially the screen. When you light up the screen, you can feel the beauty of it without me saying anything more. The screen, which is almost equal in width on all four sides, puts me in a happy mood every time I use the phone. If there is no front camera, I think it is the best looking screen in the world.\\n\\nSome people will ask: why don’t you buy Samsung S22? Haha, see Snapdragon 8 Gen 1, do you think I still want to buy it? In addition to the excellent bezel width, other specs are also very powerful. This Samsung E6 panel ensures high brightness while DC dimming is not missing. Adaptive colors, or “True Tone” on the iPhone, are also available. Some people complain that the standard version doesn’t have 2K resolution, but the Xiaomi 13 the display DPI is actually 414, which is sharper than most FHD+ phones. Using 2K resolution on a small phone can also bring down battery life, so the display is really good for just the right amount of time.\\n\\nPERFORMANCE & GAMING\\nSnapdragon 8 Gen 2, LPDDR5X and UFS 4.0, the latest chips are of course there. The throttling test also shows that it can keep the performance stable for a long time, so it seems that the 8 Gen 2 has really improved a lot.\\nSmaller phones are usually not very good at gaming because of their size limits. But the Xiaomi 13 is an exception. Maybe it’s the new 8 Gen 2 that’s so great, or maybe the cooling system is so nice. Anyway, it does well in Genshin Impact, running around Sumeru can’t stress it out anymore. There were lags during the game, all caused by loading textures. To test how long it takes for Xiaomi 13 to overheat, I followed it up with 25 minutes on Spiral Abyss floor 12, and it still held up. Oh, and the frame drops in the middle were caused by loading, not lagging. The temperature after 45 minutes of intense gaming is also only 45°C.\\n\\nAll in all, it has no problem handling games. But I still don’t recommend it for long term gaming, because the screen is really small. If you have big hands, it will be more difficult to play.\\n\\nCompared to the Pro version, the standard version seems to have a less surprising camera system. It does have an average camera performance, but because of this 75mm telephoto lens, it stands out from the crowd of small sized phones. The reason I used to have to use big and heavy flagship phones is that I love telephoto lenses. And most of my photography is taken with telephoto. Now that the Xiaomi 13 also has a 3.2x telephoto and is equipped with OIS, then I can use it with no worries. But don’t get me wrong, I mean an extra telephoto will allow you to compose more angles compared to other compact phones. But the image quality is definitely not as good as flagship phones.\\n\\nWhen the light is bad, as long as you zoom in on the picture, there is very little detail and all are sharpening traces. Just like the S22, it really can’t put a bigger sensor. So let’s give it a pass.\\n\\nCAMERA\\n\\nCompared to the Xiaomi 12S, the 13’s main camera is a step backwards. Although the sensor is smaller, the performance is not much of a step back. Most of the performance is okay, both day and night. I only have two complaints, one is the purple-fringing issue, which is not very well controlled. Another is that the color is a bit strange. Even though we were using the Leica Vibrant mode, the colors were always very dull. The too-intense colors look even worse in the samples taken on cloudy days. These two problems are even worse on the ultra-wide camera. So I’m actually not satisfied with the ultra-wide camera.\\n\\nBut then again, if I am given two options, a telephoto plus a good main camera, or a very good main camera plus a macro lens, I would definitely choose the former. Users of smaller phones must know what they need, because most of the time they are not able to have both.\\n\\nYou should not expect anything from the Xiaomi phone front camera. Except for the Civi series, they all perform pretty much the same. Although the photos look good and rich in detail. But the video performance is really not good. Not only is the 4k resolution missing, but it doesn’t even support 60fps. If you pay more attention to the recording of the front camera, then we recommend you to buy other phones.\\n\\nAll three lenses support different recording specs. The main camera supports up to 8k 24fps and OIS+EIS. the footage also looks the best, stable and clear. The ultra-wide camera supports up to 4k 30fps, which is also good. But the picture does not look so clear. The telephoto camera supports up to 1080P 60fps. only in 1080P 30fps can switch the lens during recording.\\n\\nBATTERY & CHARGING\\n\\n67w fast charging and 4500mAh battery, does it sound familiar? Yes, this classic combination is once again found in the Xiaomi 13. I have no complaints about the charging power, 67w is also fast and there is also 50w wireless charging. Plugged in and fully charged in just 41 minutes.\\n\\n4500mAh is big for a phone of this size, and in actual use it feels about the same as my 12S Ultra, which lasts 5 to 6 hours. Because of the new processor being more power efficient and the smaller screen, it already lasts about the same amount of time as many 6.8 inch phones. One less factor to stop you from buying a smaller phone, isn’t it?\\nAfter a few days of use, MIUI 14 has no lags or bugs. Their claim of improving the smoothness of the new system seems to be working so far. No matter how fast your operation is, it doesn’t lag. I don’t know if older Xiaomi phones will be smoother with the MIUI 14 upgrade, but at least with my Xiaomi 13, MIUI 14 is definitely smooth enough.\\n\\nThere are relatively few new features in 14, one of which is the new icon customization feature. Some icons can change shape, but some can’t. The new folders also open the applications inside of it from the outside. Obviously, MIUI 14 also borrows some features from other systems. But it doesn’t matter to consumers, as long as it works, it’s fine. The biggest upgrade of MIUI 14 should still be this: you can delete most of the system applications. Those apps that you never use can finally be uninstalled. Even the album, weather, can be uninstalled. You can keep only 8 apps, it’s very crazy for MIUI.\\nWhen Xiaomi 13 was released, I was very happy because Xiaomi almost created my dream phone. It fits my hand perfectly and didn’t lose important features. Especially the screen, until the S23 was released, I thought the Xiaomi 13 was the best small size flagship in Android. I will also keep my SIM card in this phone all the time, waiting for the next phone to come along that will fascinate me so much.\\n\\nTAGSXiaomiXiaomi 13Xiaomi 13 Pro'],\n",

       "  'Summarize the following.\\nTitle: \"What is edge computing? - YouTube\"\\nTranscript: \"Edge computing is what it sounds like: computing that takes place at the edge of corporate networks, with “the edge” being defined as the place where end devices access the rest of the network – things like phones, laptops, industrial robots, and sensors. The edge used to be a place where these devices connected so they could deliver data to, and receive instructions and download software updates from a centrally located data center or the cloud. Now with the explosion of the Internet of Things, that model has shortcomings. IoT devices gather so much data that the sheer volume requires larger and more expensive connections to data centers and the cloud. The nature of the work performed by these IoT devices is also creating a need for much faster connections between the data center or cloud and the devices. For example, if sensors in valves at a petroleum refinery detect dangerously high pressure in the pipes, shutoffs need to be triggered as soon as possible. With analysis of that pressure data taking place at distant processing centers, the automatic shutoff instructions may come too late. But with processing power placed local to the end devices, latency is less, and that roundtrip time can be significantly reduced, potentially saving downtime, damage to property and even lives. Even with the introduction of edge devices that provide local computing and storage, there will still be a need to connect them to data centers, whether they are on premises or in the cloud. For example, temperature and humidity sensors in agricultural fields gather valuable data, but that data doesn’t have to be analyzed or stored in real time. Edge devices can collect, sort and perform preliminary analysis of the data, then send it along to where it needs to go: to centralized applications or some form of long-term storage, again either on-prem or in the cloud. Because this traffic may not be time-sensitive, slower, less expensive connections – possibly over the internet – can be used. And because the data is presorted, the volume of traffic that needs to be sent at all may be reduced. So the upside of edge computing is faster response time for applications that require it and slowing the growth of expensive long-haul connections to processing and storage centers. The downside can be security. With data being collected and analyzed at the edge, it’s important to include security for the IoT devices that connect to the edge devices and for the edge devices themselves. They contains valuable data, but they are also network elements that, if exploited, could compromise other devices that contain stores of valuable assets. With edge computing becoming more essential, it’s also important to make sure that the edge devices themselves don’t become a single point of failure. Network architects need to build in redundancy and provide failover contingencies in order to avoid crippling downtime if a primary node goes down. The industry has already gone a long way toward addressing the demands of edge computing, and it is becoming mainstream. Its importance is likely to grow even more as the use of real-time applications becomes more prevalent.\"',\n",

are lagging no matter what you try and do you just can\\'t seem to fix it this could be in terms of your energy this could be in terms of anxiety this could be in terms of your career you\\'re not making the steps that you thought you would you\\'re not making the money that you thought you would you\\'re not being the dad the partner the husband that you wanted to be if you\\'re just not showing up as the man that you you thought you would be by now this is going to be really really helpful for you you\\'ve probably tried everything under the sun in order to fix it but every time you do something every time you make even an inch of progress something just drags you back down and so you work your ass off again to try and get back up to where you want to be it could be financially it could be with your relationships it could be the way that you look and you make a bit of progress and then something drags you back down again and no matter what happens you just can\\'t seem to get everything that you want if that sounds familiar keep listening because I got something for you which is really really simple and is going to really really uh easily help you fix it so okay so I\\'ll switch over to the iPad right now this is a very very incredibly lifelike drawing of a Summoner Mountain down here is you once again very like flag here is base camp and then up the top is the summit okay oops I just erased that up the top is the summit okay I\\'m just going to briefly outline these Concepts where you are right now you\\'re on what we call the hamster wheel right where you\\'re constantly working your ass off but it feels like you\\'re not really getting anywhere or you\\'re not getting anywhere as fast as what you should be it feels inefficient and it feels like you have a high level of friction right things are just more difficult than what they should be base camp is where you\\'re at Square zero you\\'re at Ground Zero you\\'re just about to start your climb everything\\'s totally neutral and the Summit is where you want to be this is where you\\'re the ultimate Dad this is where you\\'re the ultimate partner or husband this is where you\\'re making the money you\\'re living your dream life this is where everything is great your Health\\'s incredible your relationships are incredible and your wealth is also so incredible right everything is absolutely on song and that\\'s obviously where you want to be and one of the things that we see that prevents a lot of dudes from actually getting to the summit Step One is they don\\'t know what Summit they\\'re actually climbing what is it that they\\'re working towards a lot of guys get confused because there are so many different Summers that we can climb I mean let\\'s think about it you a lot of guys go out and they chase money they chose huge amounts of money they just want to build a massive amount of wealth a lot of other guys want to chase lifestyle some guys Trace Chase drugs some guys chase women some guys Chase there\\'s so many different things that we can chase but what is absolutely certain is that if you climb up an alternate Summit because remember there are millions of these Summits you\\'ve got money up here you\\'ve got you know drugs over here you\\'ve got women over on another one you\\'ve got whatever we\\'ve got all these different goals that we can chase all these different Summers that we can chase but if they\\'re not in an alignment with what we actually want when we reach them we\\'re going to be totally unfilled and that\\'s where we climb up one mountain we come back down we climb up another we come back down and we never feel like we\\'re actually getting anywhere so the very first thing that we need to do is we need to get clear on well what is my Summit what do I actually want from this life when I\\'m old and gray and smelly and my Skin\\'s all falling out and I\\'ve got tubes up my ass down my throat up my up my nose there\\'s a machine helping my lungs to pump what do I want to look back on on my life how do I want to have envisioned my life so that\\'s the first thing we need to get really really clear on what do we want our Summit to be then the next thing after that that we need to do is we need to get out of the hamster wheel right we need to get off this world because whenever we\\'re stuck here on the hamster wheel we\\'re just going around and around and around and around in circles and we\\'ll never actually make it up the mountain it\\'ll never happen so the first step is that we need to get from here on the hamster wheel onto base camp and what base camp looks like is this you\\'ve got no friction there\\'s nothing holding you back those anchors those things which are just dragging you down all the time you don\\'t have them you have incredible energy you have no anxiety you\\'re managing your stress really well you\\'ll never evade stress completely in life but you\\'ll know how to deal with it you\\'re on point physically mentally and you\\'re clear on the direction that you need to go that is what we call base camp and once you get to base camp that\\'s where you can actually start the ascent at the summit see one of the other big reasons why so many guys never actually make it up this Summit is because they\\'re trying to climb on the biggest climb of their life stressed out anxious with low testosterone terrible energy they just feel awful can you imagine climbing Mount Everest and feeling like that it\\'s never going to happen and see the thing climbing to your goal and climbing to your whole life\\'s purpose which is essentially what your summit is it\\'s the biggest climate you\\'ll ever do in your life and it\\'s permanent if you\\'re trying to do that bad boy with no energy stressed out anxious low testosterone feeling awful you\\'re never going to make it and so what we need to do is we need to get you to base camp first where you\\'re feeling really good and then we can begin the climb and so the next thing once we\\'ve got you here at base camp what do you need when you\\'re at base camp you need this you need a map if you don\\'t have a map you\\'re never going to make it up the mountain I don\\'t know if you guys have ever done any mountain climb but I\\'ve done a fair bit and so it always helps to learn how to actually get up to the top because if you wing it on the way it\\'s really really slow the next thing that you always need is you need a guide you need a sherpa as such Edmund Hillary Sir Edmund Hillary the man the first man to Summit Mount Everest or the first white man I think that was able to Summit Mount Everest he failed twice before he only got it on the third time do you know the difference between the first two times and the third it\\'s the third time you had some sherpets he had a sherbet tensing Norge was his name right who actually helped him guide guide him all the way up the mountain and so what we need if we\\'re going to get from base camp all the way up to the summit is we need to have a map a plan and we need to have a guide on how you\\'re going to get there when you have those two things that is when you\\'ll be able to get to the summit okay and so this is really really incredibly important so what I want you to take away from from this video is this first of all if you want to get to where you want to be if you want to be able to actually make more money if you want to be able to be a better dad you want to be a better partner you want to be happier you want to be healthy you want to feel better well first of all you need to know what the Summit is you need to know where your summit is you need to know what game you\\'re playing not somebody else\\'s game not society\\'s game not someone says hey you should be a doctor you should be making this amount of money this is how you should be as a dad you need to have exactly three kids what game are you playing so it\\'s the first thing Clarity the second thing after that is we need to get you off the hamster wheel and get you up to base camp because when you\\'re at base camp that\\'s when you can actually get up to the top and the third thing is you need a map and you need a guide and that is how you get there you\\'re not just going to wing it on the way up because as there are going to be obstacles as we all know you need to make sure that you have a plan on how you\\'re going to get to your summit and you need to have someone there who\\'s going to hold you accountable and guide you the whole way okay on that note guys I\\'ll leave you all to it if you have any questions as always feel free to reach out I hope this helps\"\\nVideo Summary:'],\n",

       "  'With no explanation, label A→B with either \"CON\" or \"PRO\".\\nA: I will argue that the Marvel movie \\'Ant Man\\' starring Paul Rudd, is overratedCon will argue that its not3 rounds, 3000 characters, 24 hours between rounds\\'Overrated\\' in this case is defined as \\'receiving hype and adoration that it does not otherwise deserve\\'. Whoever accepts the debate agrees to this definition Arguments:1) Recycled plotlineOne of the main \\'twists\\' central to the plot in the movie Ant Man is that the guys who Darren Cross (the villain) plans to sell the yellow jacket suit to turn out to be operatives for Hydra, an evil organization first featured in Captain America 1... While some people may have been blown away from this revelation, others who watched \\'Captain America: The Winter Soldier\\' were not blown away, since the exact same twist happened in that movie as well... In The Winter Soldier, operatives of SHIELD were found out to be loyal to Hydra, and the exact same \\'twist\\' was used in Ant Man. Since Ant Man used plot pieces from prior Marvel movies as the main development in their own movie, this makes Ant Man overrated due to lack of a truly original plot. 2) Lack of a terrifying villainDarren Cross was the main bad guy in Ant Man. For those of you who forgot that, I don\\'t blame you.... Darren Cross is the least remarkable villain in the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe, his only power being that the suit he wears allows him to grow super small and gain super strength, like Ant-Man.... Darren Cross, \\'Yellow Jacket\\', is a far more inferior villain compared to other villains in the Marvel franchise in terms of overall power. Thor villain ============ That soldier who becomes an even bigger Hulk than HulkIron Man 1 villain ======= Obadiah Stone, who makes his own iron man suitCaptain America villain == Red Skull, a legit Nazi leaderThor Villain ============ Loki, a Nordic God who wielded the power of an infinity stoneIron Man 2 villain ======= Ivan Vanko, who makes a similar iron man suit and even hijacks iron man droidsThor 2 villain =========== The Dark Elves, who also had the power of an infinity stoneCaptain America 2 ======= The Winter Soldier + Hydra operativesGuardians villain ======== Ronan, who also had the power of an infinity stone Iron Man 3 villain ======= Aldrich Killian who using extremis becomes a super villain The point is that overall, the main villain in Ant Man is not only far inferior to the villains shown in other marvel movies, but is in fact the most inferior, in terms of terrifying qualities and strength. 3) Lack of a powerful heroThere is a huge gap in the power of villains in Ant Man and the rest of the Marvel universe, and the same can be said of the heroes as well. Ant Man can grow small as his strength grows, but no one in their right mind would believe that Ant Man could take down Thor, Hulk, Iron Man, Vision, etc... The huge gap in power of the people in Ant Man to the people in the rest of the Marvel movies are enough to indicate that overall, Ant Man is overrated\\nB: The movie \\'Ant-Man\\' is overrated',\n",

Caesar was stabbed to death at a meeting of the Senate. As many as 60 conspirators, led by Brutus and Cassius, were involved. According to Plutarch, a seer had warned that harm would come to Caesar no later than the Ides of March. On his way to the Theatre of Pompey, where he would be assassinated, Caesar passed the seer and joked, \"The Ides of March are come\", implying that the prophecy had not been fulfilled, to which the seer replied \"Aye, Caesar; but not gone.\" This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare\\'s play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to \"beware the Ides of March.\" The Roman biographer Suetonius identifies the \"seer\" as a haruspex named Spurinna.\\n\\nAnswer this question based on the passage: who was told beware the ides of march?\\nCoT: The important part for answering this question is: This meeting is famously dramatised in William Shakespeare\\'s play Julius Caesar, when Caesar is warned by the soothsayer to \"beware the Ides of March.\"\\n\\nAns: July\\nQues: World War I (often abbreviated as WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918.

       "  'Given a square with side length $x$, if we cut out four identical right-angled isosceles triangles from each corner of the square, what is the length of the side of the smaller square in the middle? Assume that the area of the smaller square is equal to the area of the original square. Provide the value of $x$ in terms of the length of the side of the smaller square. \\nHint: The triangles are not to be feared! \\n[Mark down]\\nThe area of the original square is $x^2$. If we cut out four identical right-angled isosceles triangles from each corner of the square, the side length of the resulting square is $(x-2s)$, where $s$ is the length of each leg of the right-angled isosceles triangle. Thus, the area of the resulting square is $(x-2s)^2$. \\nWe are given that the area of the resulting square is equal to the area of the original square. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: \\n$x^2 = (x-2s)^2$\\nExpanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get: \\n$x^2 = x^2 - 4xs + 4s^2$\\nSubtracting $x^2$ from both sides, we get: \\n$0 = -4xs + 4s^2$\\nDividing both sides by $4s$, we get: \\n$0 = -x + s$\\nTherefore, we have $s = x$. \\nSubstituting this into the equation $x^2 = (x-2s)^2$, we get: \\n$x^2 = (x-2x)^2$\\nSimplifying, we get: \\n$x^2 = 4x^2$\\nDividing both sides by $x^2$, we get: \\n$1 = 4$\\nThis is a contradiction, so there is no solution.',\n",

       "  \"I need to write a functional specification document on a data integration project to be conducted using Azure Data Factory. The end destination of this data orchestration project is a SQL database and Marketo. The SQL database will be used to assess data quality and track the source of the selective data that is pushed to Marketo at the end. The format of the data that will be pushed to Marketo should be a single table with the following columns: email, products used and prospect type. the sql database should contain two tables, one called contacts and the other called primary contacts. The contact table should contain the emails found from the data sources with metadata fields whereas the source info table should list down the data source of those emails in which each email was enriched with.\\n\\nHere's the description of the project needs with examples: I need to ingest the data from multiple internal data sources used in my company to extract information like products used on an an email level. If for example, in one of the data sources called salesforce opportunities, we find that we have sold product12 to email rob@abc.com who has an account ID 54e, then we will fetch all emails in the salesforce contacts database with the same email domain @abc.com or account ID 54e, and add 'product12' to their 'products used' column for Marketo. If the data ingestion from another data source called ods finds that we have sold product6 to samantha@abc.com, then we will update all of the found emails from earlier with product6 in their 'products used' field. All of their products used fields should contain a contatenated string of the unique products used separated by comma. So for our examples, we would have 'product12, product6' in their products used fields. Since rob@abc.com and samantha@abc.com were the contacts we sold the products to and it was their email domains or account ids that we used to fetch all other related contacts, they are the primary contacts. This should be indicated in the sql database contact table where their 'primary contact' column in the table have the value set to TRUE. Whereas the other contacts we found in the salesforce contacts database using these primary contact email domains or account ids would have the primary contact field set to false in the contact table of the sql database. Each contact in the contacts table should have an ID. This ID will be stored as a foreign key in the primary contacts table. Ultimately, I should be able to make queries where I join the two tables and see all the primary contacts linked to the non-primary contacts of the contacts table. The primary contacts table should have a column called data source that mentions that data source in which the primary contact was sourced from. This field is not needed in the contacts table since all non-primary contacts would have originally came from the salesforce contacts database.\\n\\nWrite the documentation for me extensively in detail for please, with illustrations and data models. Also mention what componenents I would need to use on data factory as well resources like sql database and an azure blob storage for example.

       "  \"How does the heavy reliance on technology make infrastructure susceptible to corruption and terror attacks from radical/extremist organizations? Answer according to: In the spirit of the Lint Center's aim to progress the next generation of National Security with support for well-rounded individuals, we are proud to present the Mid-Year 2012 Scholarship Winner essays to Lint Center affiliates.\\nNational Security threats have plagued the United States since our independence from British rule. As a nation, we have discovered ways to ensure the safety of our citizens, freedoms, and democracy. The establishment of myriad intelligence and law enforcement agencies has met the challenges that arise as a result of our democratic growth and development. These agencies have been organized to target and attack national security threats, both foreign and domestic. The public perception of national security threats are often associated with a range of issues, from narcotics smuggling, weapons, and human trafficking to domestic and foreign terror attacks.\\nAs technology advances new threats emerge. Advanced technology has become an increasingly prevalent tool for radical/extremist groups to carry out threats against the US. With the world’s increasing reliance on technology, so too has the US’s reliance on technology for the operation of defense systems, natural resources management, and economic development. Disconcertedly, the heavy reliance on technology makes infrastructure itself susceptible to corruption and terror attacks from radical/extremist organizations. This vector poses a very viable threat to national security, one that requires a specific skill set to develop effective solutions to ongoing threats.\\nUntil recently most agencies defended their targeted national security issues independently without much interest in sharing intelligence with the rest of the law enforcement and intelligence community. These agencies run operations targeting these threats independently, meanwhile, other agencies may be conducting identical operations and targeting the same threats. Thus, both agencies are conducting and developing their own intelligence and investigative leads, without sharing this crucial information with the other agency. Bridging these communication gaps will help solidify a cohesive investigation to target these threats and the investment in collaborative task forces will better defend the nation from multiple national security threats stemming from radical/extremist groups.\\nMost organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, do not solely threaten the US on one front. The Sinaloa Cartel’s illicit schemes encompass multiple national security issues in order to accomplish their overall goals. Though one of the most dangerous cartels in Mexico, they are still not considered a terrorist organization because their motives are financially-based, however, their actions still plague national security. In order to smuggle drugs into the US and secure power within Mexico, the Sinaloa Cartel must traffic humans, narcotics, weapons, and money to and from Mexico. The aforementioned crimes are national security issues investigated independently by numerous agencies from the FBI, ATF, DEA, Border Patrol, ICE Homeland Security Investigations to other state and local Law enforcement agencies. Greater collaborative or joint task forces could help bridge the intelligence and communications gap between agencies, as well as assist with jurisdictional concerns.\\nMany agencies also face jurisdictional dilemmas involving the investigation and prosecution of subjects and their illicit activity. With collaborative efforts agencies like the Tucson Police Department and Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations can better use their unique resources to develop a better intelligence picture which can lead to successful investigations charging subjects on a multi-jurisdictional level. Partnering the Border Patrol with ATF can assist with the investigating and prosecuting of the smuggling of humans and weapons, meanwhile partnering with the FBI can bridge intelligence gaps for potential terror threats.\\nThese partnerships can also encourage resource collaboration. The violence and the illicit activity along the southwest border far surpass the rest of the country. However, smaller agencies have not seen an increase in manpower in relation to the rising crime rates. Further, the majority of federal investigative agencies do not have the law enforcement personnel or the intelligence and enforcement resources needed to conduct the most comprehensive investigations. Larger agencies, like the Border Patrol and some State agencies, can provide the necessary resources needed to keep up with the larger more sophisticated organizations. Thus, combining these resources can enhance the ability for all law enforcement agencies to combat national security threats.\\nCollaborative or joint task forces are becoming and will be the most proficient way to conduct law enforcement operations in the future. In addition to joint task forces, many agencies within the law enforcement community are establishing a new collaborative effort in intelligence fusions centers. A fusion center’s sole purpose is to share resources and de-conflict amongst partnering agencies. De-confliction conveys to investigative agencies that their investigations are not being pursued by other agencies.\\nUltimately, it is the goal of every agency is to ensure that the freedoms, safety, and democracy for all US citizens are preserved and protected against national security threats, and simply, this can be most effectively combatted through the means of collaboration.\"],\n",

rbt resistance band training i\\'m james grage and today we\\'re going to talk about how to get started with resistance band training the first thing that i want to jump into and this is one of the more common questions that i get is the difference between a flat or loop style power band which is what a lot of people call this versus a tube style resistance band where you see then it\\'s got all these attachments here on the end and handles now when i first started working out with resistance bands about 11 years ago this is how i started with these tube style bands and then through the years i end up migrating over to this style which is this power style band and i\\'ll explain to you why and a lot of this has to do with what\\'s called linear variable resistance so what linear variable resistance means is the more that you stretch a band the harder it gets and that\\'s one of the nice things about bands is for example with these under sun fitness bands if i were to hang this one back up you can see that i\\'ve got five different levels of resistance those come in a little drawstring bag and so one of the most common questions is well does that mean i only have five levels of resistance in other words if you were to equate that to dumbbells would it be the same as only having five dumbbells and the answer is no and that\\'s because of linear variable resistance so let\\'s jump into that let\\'s talk about what that is and how do you get different levels of resistance using this tube style band as an example there\\'s a few ways that you can increase the resistance by stretching the band more now with these i can stretch the band more by widening my stance so if i stand really narrow you see i\\'ve got more band here so it\\'s not stretched as much in my starting position so it\\'s going to be easier here at the beginning or if i want to pre-stretch the band i can widen my stance and now i\\'m stretching the band creating more resistance so that is the basics of linear variable resistance now there\\'s a couple different ways that you can do it but there\\'s a limitation with these and that is because of the handles themselves so it\\'s nice and convenient to have these handles to grab onto but it also eliminates one of the ways that you can create different levels of resistance if we go over here to the loop style band so if i stand on this anchor it under my feet the exact same way i can grab this at the top like this or if i want more resistance and if i want to adjust it in incremental levels i can just grab further down on the band and create more resistance go even further down pre-stretch it more and create even more resistance and i can keep doing that so i\\'ve got almost i\\'m not going to say unlimited levels of resistance but i\\'ve got so many different variations and that\\'s why when people ask well what is the equivalent resistance level in one of these bands compared to free weights and the first thing i say is depends on how much you stretch it so for example with the extra light band this has a range of about 5 to 15 pounds again the difference between 5 pounds versus 15 is how much you stretch it when we come over to the light band we\\'ve got 20 to 35 pounds of resistance coming to a medium band 30 to 50 pounds of resistance the heavy band roughly 40 to 80 pounds of resistance and then we come into the monster here this is the extra heavy and we\\'ve got anywhere from 50 to 120 pounds of resistance so let\\'s talk about all those ways that we can adjust the resistance level so you saw two ways already one is our foot position how wide is our stance and how much are we stretching the band the second one is adjusting our hand position which is why i like these flat style bands because i have more flexibility than i do with a tube style but the other way is adjusting the distance from our anchor point so that takes us into the next topic which is anchored exercises versus unanchored exercises so if anyone\\'s following the ta2 program which stands for train anytime train anywhere which is the program that i developed using resistance bands in the first month of the program we do unanchored exercises meaning that we\\'re anchoring the band with our own body the reason i do that is it\\'s giving you a foundation of exercises that you can do anywhere you don\\'t need a doorway you don\\'t need to anchor it to a pull-up bar all you need is your own body so you could do this on the beach you could do it on top of a mountain you could do it on the moon if you wanted to if you can get to the moon so let\\'s talk about anchored exercises so those are unanchored meaning we\\'re using our body now anchored exercises meaning we\\'re anchoring it to something so there\\'s a couple ways to do that the first reach over here this is a door anchor and this is a really awesome little tool and if you look at this on one side it\\'s got a round piece of foam with a hard plastic core in it that the strap runs through and on the other side is a loop now we can use any door i\\'ve got a fake door here yes i have a fake door in the studio i\\'m going to come over here and show you how this works so open the door and you put the soft foam side through the door keep the strap nice and flat and you\\'re going to shut the door now i do recommend doing it the opposite way that i just did it meaning it\\'s better to anchor on the side of the door that closes and that way when you\\'re pulling on this there\\'s no chance of the door coming open you\\'re actually pulling the door shut which is what you want to do so don\\'t really have a choice here so that is step one if you do have to anchor it on the side of the door that opens make sure you lock the door eliminate that risk of this thing coming open so now we take a band we run it through the loop and then we run it through itself it\\'s called the lark knot and that is how we anchor the band now we can come over we can do all sorts of different exercises exercise i can do rows i could do biceps here and depending on where we anchor the band we can get different angles so for example right here we\\'ve got something that\\'s close to chest height if i were to put it over the top of the door now we can do things like triceps push downs we can do lat pull downs anything from a high angle and of course we can do the opposite we can go low and we can do biceps curls different things now here\\'s one of the things common questions that i get they say well how do i keep the door anchor first from sliding up and down the door so if you\\'re doing a high anchor point and you\\'re pulling down you don\\'t want to do it on the side of the door because as you pull of course it\\'s going to want to slide down same thing if you\\'re anchoring low it\\'s going to want to pull up so anchor over the top of the door or go underneath the door so make sure any of those low points or high points are going to the top of the door bottom of the door anything else you can go if it\\'s pretty much from let\\'s say mid thigh to shoulder height then you\\'re definitely going to want to anchor it on the side of the door now going back to what we were talking about with linear variable resistance just wanted to show you the door anchor here our third way of creating more resistance again is stretching the band but now we\\'re going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i\\'m creating more resistance let\\'s say that i\\'m in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that\\'s too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little bit of the band slip through my hand and i can adjust again is stretching the band but now we\\'re going to do it by distancing ourselves from our anchor point so the further i step away the more i stretch the band so now i\\'m creating more resistance let\\'s say that i\\'m in the middle of my set and i get to five reps i go ah that\\'s too hard all i have to do two things one i can step forward therefore lessening the resistance now i can finish my set or the other thing that i can do is i just let a little years ago and that\\'s why i prefer these over the tube style bands okay now there\\'s a couple variations when it comes to adjusting our foot position or hand position so let me show you those real quick so let me grab this extra light band now a lot of the big guys are like what am i going to use an extra light band for but trust me if you use it the right way for certain exercises this band is very helpful i use this band a lot so here\\'s a good example let\\'s say we want to do side raises for shoulders here when it comes to side raise i don\\'t just want resistance in a vertical plane ideally i would like resistance at this angle right here so what i can do if i\\'m going to do it on my right side anchor it under my right foot now i\\'m going to step on it with my left grab it with my right now look at this angle of pull right here so not only am i adjusting my resistance level but i can change the direction of it which is one of the nice things about resistance band training again is having resistance in different planes now if i take bands again whether i anchor them over there on the door or use a a pull-up bar same thing i can change my angle of pull now as i curl this up right there at the peak of the contraction i\\'ve got maximum resistance and that\\'s what you want when you\\'re building muscle you want to activate as many muscle fibers as possible and so that\\'s why those good squeezes at the top it\\'s like an isometric contraction are very important and having maximum resistance at the peak of that contraction is really important so each side and you say well i\\'m ready to jump up and so you put another plate on each side and that\\'s 225 well we can do the same thing with bands and that\\'s simply just adding bands together and all you want to do try to lay them as flat as possible but don\\'t try to micromanages it\\'s not a big deal if there\\'s little twists in them you just anchor them under your feet and there you go now you just increase the resistance level and now you have even more flexibility because you can do the same things is why i recommend gloves now i went 20 plus years of working out in the gym with free weights never ever using gloves when it comes to resistance bands i always use them because just the texture of them as they stretch it creates a lot of friction so you don\\'t want to take the skin off your hand as far as style of glove look you can go to any auto parts store you can get full fingered gloves and they\\'ll work i actually designed a set of gloves here that has padding on the inside of the thumb and the outside when it comes to these tube style bands it\\'s a double-edged sword like most things in life the handles are convenient they\\'re nice but by the time you add up the handles the metal rings the metal carabiners through all your different levels of resistance it adds a lot of weight and i found that when i was using these they were too bulky and they were too heavy one of the things i like about these especially with the five different levels of resistance which is all i\\'ve been working out with for the sometimes it\\'s difficult to juggle all those things and fit your work out into your schedule so let\\'s imagine it\\'s a long day you didn\\'t get your workout in the morning you tell yourself all day long i\\'m gonna go to the gym in the afternoon but all of a sudden five o\\'clock rolls around you go home you go you change your clothes put your gym clothes on you go oh man i gotta get in the car i gotta drive to the gym so for me the 15 minutes of driving to the gym and then parking and the 15 minutes driving something this big and clunky and heavy i wanted light and uh and compact so moving on so we covered linear variable resistance what that is and what the resistance levels are how to adjust the resistance level which brings me to the next common question which is where do i start which band do i pick up you know do i do i start my biceps exercises with the heavy do i go to the extra heavy best advice i can give you is you need to change the way that you think one of the common mistakes that i see people making a gym so even if you\\'re and you take yourself to fail you\\'re only using good form not at the cost of doing cheat reps in bad form but now conversely what if you come in the next week and you feel stronger than the previous week you did 10 reps last week but now all of a sudden you get to 10 and you feel like you\\'ve got you know maybe three reps left in your gas tank do you just stop at 10 no you keep going you push yourself and that is training by feel that\\'s learning to know what your limits are and pushing yourself to that benefits of the linear variable resistance and being able to adjust on the fly because you can start off harder if you want to let\\'s say you\\'re going for 10 reps do the first five and do them really hard and if you can\\'t get the rest like i said adjust your your foot position or your distance to anchor point or your hand position lessen the resistance a little finish out your set but finish it strong so those are all the key points with getting started with resistance bands now there\\'s a lot of questions of how bands compare to gym what do you need well you need a bench why because with free weights you only have one plane of resistance which is the vertical plane because we are pressing against gravity so in other words to train our chest we have to lay on our back so we can press straight up with bands we don\\'t need that because we have resistance in multiple planes because the resistance or the tension created isn\\'t from gravity but it\\'s from the band itself so now we can stand up and we can press in front of us we can press up above we strength this is a functional strength and that\\'s one of the things that i really like about resistance bands\"'],\n",
       " 39: ['Creating Engaging E-Learning Resources for Grade 12 Teacher Education.\\n\\nOverview:\\n\\nThe project based lesson plan will have students create an interactive e-learning activity or resource for a specific group in the Teacher Education subject area. The goal of this lesson is to develop a structured and engaging learning experience that can be used by the target group.\\n\\nStudents will be able to:\\n\\n1. Students will be able to create a subject-oriented interactive learning resource.\\n2. Students will be able to develop a structured and interactive e-learning activity or resource for a specific group in their subject specialism.\\n3. Students will be able to identify the needs of the target group and design a resource that meets those needs.\\n4. Students will be able to evaluate the effectiveness of their e-learning activity or resource. \\n5. Students will be able to use feedback from peers and instructors to refine their e-learning resources.\\n\\nLesson Plan:\\n\\nProject Idea: \\nStudents will be tasked with creating an engaging e-learning resource for Grade 12 Teacher Education. They will need to research and explore what makes an effective e-learning resource and use this knowledge to create their own. \\n\\nExploration: \\nThe teacher will lead the students in a discussion about what makes an effective e-learning resource, covering topics such as visuals, audio, interactivity, relevance, and accuracy. The teacher may also provide some examples of good e-learning resources for the students to analyze. \\n\\nBrainstorm and Plan: \\nThe students will then brainstorm ideas for their own e-learning resource and create a plan outlining the content, structure, visuals, audio, interactivity etc. that they plan to include in their resource. They should also identify any potential challenges or issues that may arise during the creation process. \\n\\nCreate: \\nThe students will then use their plan to create their own e-learning resource using technology tools of their choice (e.g., PowerPoint, Adobe Creative Suite). They should be encouraged to experiment with different media types and technologies to make their resource as engaging as possible. \\n\\nFeedback and Iterate: \\nOnce the students have finished creating their resources they will present them to the class for feedback and critique. The teacher can then help guide the students in making improvements or changes based on the feedback they received from peers. This process can be repeated multiple times until the students are satisfied with the final product. \\n\\nReflection: Finally, the teacher should lead a class discussion where each student reflects on what they learned during this project-based lesson and how it has helped them develop skills related to creating effective e-learning resources.',\n",

That number would have been considerably lower were it not for the addition of\\n25,000 temporary census workers.\\nThe report was not all bleak — wages rose at a healthy clip, and people who had not been looking for work returned\\nto the job market — but the signs of a slowdown were unmistakable. The private sector added just 96,000 jobs, a\\nsteep deceleration from earlier in the year.\\nThe report also revised down job gains for June and July by a total of 20,000.\\n“We’ve lost steam — there’s no question we are slowing,” said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Grant Thornton.\\n“We are losing momentum.”\\nWorries about a potential recession have mounted in recent weeks, driven by the trade war, new evidence of\\nweaker growth in Asia and Europe, and movements in the bond market. Another negative factor is that the stimulus\\nfrom the tax cut enacted in late 2017 is fading.\\nPresident Trump imposed a new 15 percent tariff on more than $100 billionworth of Chinese imports, many of them\\nconsumer goods, at the start of this month. And the administration has said an existing 25 percent tariff on $250\\nbillion in Chinese products will rise to 30 percent in October.\\nAfter the jobs report, Mr. Trump said on Twitter that the economy was strong and blamed “the Fake News” for\\ncontributing to “uncertainty.”\\n[Our columnist writes that a recession is not underway but growth is clearly slowing.]\\n \\nHiring Slowed in August, but Wage Gains Accelerated\\nThe August jobs data does not suggest that a recession is imminent. The unemployment rate, for example, was\\nunchanged at 3.7 percent, near a 50-year low.

       "  'Me and a friend write seminar work.\\nOur research question is: \"How is a change in the level of the central bank interest rate on the average rent.\\nThe selected policy question will examine the relationship between the changes that apply to the central bank interest rate on the rental market. \"\\n\\nWe wrote an entire page about the importance of the study, I add what we wrote here:\\n\\nIsrael has experienced a housing crisis in recent years, when housing prices have shown skyscrapers and accessible prices have become a major issue for many households. This resulted in broad public concern and calls for immediate action by policymakers. Understanding how interest rates affect the rent in Israel will be essential for treating this crisis and developing effective policy measures in particular in the current period where there have been significant changes in the central bank interest rates. Our research question deals with the influence of interest rates on rent in Israel and is of the utmost importance for a number of reasons.\\nFirst, the housing market is a critical component of the local economy as it affects the housing market as well as other areas such as construction, financial and consumer expenses. A stable housing market is essential to promote the economic growth and stability of the economy.\\nSecond, the Israeli economy depends largely on global macroeconomic conditions, and changes in interest rates a significant impact on the state\\'s substantive economic metrics. Understanding the relationship between interest and rent changes will be crucial in the development of monetary policy that can stabilize the economy and provide the impact of economic fluctuations on the housing market.\\nThird, for changes in the rental market, there is considerable impact on different layers in the population, such as low -income tenants and first apartment buyers. For example, an increase in rental prices may make it difficult for low -income rents to fund the rent, thus endangering their economic stability. On the other hand, a decrease in rental prices can lead to a decline in rental assets, which may adversely affect the value of the property owners \\'assets and even impair the quality of the property for rent, as the right -wingers\\' willingness to invest in maintenance will be lower when the rent received from the property will be lower.\\nWe will conclude that this policy question is greatly relevant in public discourse and the current economic climate, with higher interest rates than it has been in over the past 10 years. Examining the impact of interest changes on rent in Israel will provide valuable insights into policymakers as they are navigated in the current economic environment and make decisions that will design the future of economics and housing market in the country.\\n \\nPlease add a reference to each of the three claims we wrote on the subject of research',\n",

       " 42: [\"Summarize this : i have played around with the new arc\\nbrowser and i wanted to share some early\\nthoughts and a first look at this new\\napplication today we're looking at arc\\nbrowser it's fairly new to the market um\\nthey actually were created as company in\\ndecember 2020 and essentially they've\\nhad a fair few the head of designer\\ntesla medium multiple google chrome\\naluminum and lots more famous faces\\nheading over there and they're building\\na browser that's not boring i'm going to\\ngive you a first look at it but please\\nnote that this is they've given me beta\\naccess which is really kind but it's so\\nearly days in terms of its official\\nrelease so i did even notice some small\\nthings that obviously\\nyou won't get in the final version\\nhopefully anyway\\nand i'll include um the current wait\\nlist below and if i have any invites as\\nwell i'll see what i can do too so\\nbefore we begin my name is francesco and\\ni run key productive we're going to be\\ndiving into plenty of productivity\\nreviews this is a bit of a weird one\\nbecause we don't normally do browser\\nreviews but this is more of a\\ninteresting type of browser and it's got\\nsome really interesting productivity\\nelements as part of it so i'm excited to\\ndive into this review so downloading\\nthis application is by far one of the\\nbest experiences for onboarding it\\nreally takes you through\\nsmall things like creating your account\\nalso connecting to existing applications\\nlike if you've got google chrome\\nbookmarks and things like that ready\\nit'll take you through that whole\\nexperience and safari as well if you do\\nhave that one and what's really nice is\\nit really educates you about how to use\\nthe browser before necessarily jumping\\nin so the course structure of this is\\nprobably the thing to start with the arc\\nbrowser takes a different approach to\\nfor example google chrome by removing\\nmore of these sort of toolbars so you\\ncan essentially go into this beautiful\\nfull screen view from day one and really\\nfeel like you're cocooned in the website\\nmore than actually being stuck and sort\\nof you know uh i guess with mess around\\nthe edges they've really embraced that\\napproach with the sidebar as well which\\nyou can pop open and be able to change\\ntabs as well and they've also got a\\ncommand bar which helps you to toggle\\nbetween different websites or bookmarks\\nthat you may have for easy and quick\\naccess one thing i really liked about\\nthis browser is their new feature called\\nsplit view this essentially is much like\\nmobile browsers where you can pop a\\ndifferent view open at the same time and\\nbe able to view two things at once and\\nbasically it's just easier to be able to\\ndo that instead of having sort of tabs\\nand switching between them it's really\\neasy to do and you can toggle each one\\nto fit your comfort levels as well in\\nterms of customization so the way they\\ngo about organizing your arc browser is\\nthrough spaces so if you wanted to\\ncreate tabs for different areas so for\\nexample like general or work or life or\\nspecific project you're working on you\\ncan actually do that and scrobble\\nbetween them which is a really nice\\nfeature you can also do a few different\\nproductivity things like for example\\nhaving your own library on there of\\nfiles images that connect to things like\\nyour desktop and downloads on the mac\\nbrowser which is perfect for dragging\\nstuff into websites if you're looking to\\ndo that quite fast\\nand for collaborating in real time one\\nthing i really like about this browser\\nwas the new easel thing so basically\\nit's like a bit of the collaboration\\nwhiteboard which you can flip open at\\nany time and start dragging things into\\nit but also visually demonstrating\\nthings so this is nice for sharing with\\nteam members that you might want to\\nstart collaborating on whilst you're\\ninside of the web another thing that was\\nreally nice is they actually have a new\\nnotability allowing you to create a\\nbasic note with images and the regular\\ntext formatting that you expect a really\\nsimple thing on the browser that really\\ngoes a long way and i like as well how\\nyou can take screenshots of a specific\\npart of the page really easily and be\\nable to annotate them straight away and\\ni really like how you can send them to\\nspecific easel or notes that you're\\nworking on too to be honest i quite like\\nthis collaboration abilities and just\\nbeing able to modify it a little bit\\nmore i've actually found another\\nextension that looks pretty cool on on\\ngoogle chrome and that's what the cool\\nthing is as well is they still have\\nextensions on this application which i\\nbelieve you can get through the google\\nchrome web store so extensions wise\\nyou'll still be able to use the regular\\nset of extensions that you'd expect with\\nyour arc browser and it would be using\\nthe google chrome web store so very\\ninteresting approach to that i'll have\\nto look in a bit more detail on this as\\nwell they also have this feature called\\nboost i wasn't able to use it because of\\nmy skill set\\nbut i think you can modify code on\\nspecific site and change it to how\\nyou like it if you're a css or developer\\nand you want to make a few modifications\\nthat make a site look better that you\\nroutinely visit that's my understanding\\nof it but much more for brighter minds\\nof myself so when it comes to pricing\\nand availability right now it's in beta\\nso it's closed beta so invite only i\\nreally like when you get started with\\nthis you get your own card sort of quite\\nvery nice feel when you join the\\ncommunity and\\nthe way that they've built this\\napplication is is really stunning to be\\nhonest i'll probably start lightly using\\nthis i don't like to necessarily\\ncompletely convert to it but it will\\ntake some time to get used to some\\ncertain things did take the differences\\nhaving that tab sidebar to be able to\\nfind stuff that was weird and difficult\\nto get used to however i think these are\\nsort of things that are very minor\\nthings it'll take a time to naturally\\nnavigate i've been using safari for like\\na year or so now i previously was google\\nchrome so we're traditionally set to\\nwhat we think about the web but this is\\nan interesting fresh approach with much\\nbetter design much better productivity\\nfeatures built in and an interesting\\napproach to tabs and being able to\\nmanage them in spaces so a very nice\\nfirst look at this i'm impressed and i'm\\ngoing to be keeping an eye on how they\\ndevelop this experience and how\\nand what to expect in the future so\\nthanks to the arc team for hooking me up\\nwith an account hopefully you folks\\nfound this video useful if you're\\ninterested in in more of our reviews you\\ncan check out our youtube channel which\\nyou can subscribe to below but a big\\nthank you for stopping by today and i\\nhope to see you all very soon cheerio\\nfolks\",\n",

Assume that the training data is stored in an Elasticsearch database and utilize the official Elasticsearch Java client as the database driver. Furthermore, provide a comprehensive example for a chatbot system that integrates the following capabilities: analyzing user messages to identify sentiment, generating suitable responses based on the sentiment analysis, and maintaining contextual awareness throughout the conversation. Your solution should incorporate sophisticated natural language processing techniques to precisely comprehend user intent and manage intricate dialogue flows in real-time.',\n",
       "  \"Can you develop an AI chatbot that can hold a conversation about complex philosophical concepts such as existentialism and epistemology? The chatbot should be able to understand and respond to open-ended questions and provide thoughtful insights on the subject matter. The chatbot should not only be able to provide information but also challenge the user's perspective and critical thinking skills. Can you create a chatbot that can pass as a human philosopher? Give it a try and see!\",\n",
       "  'What are some examples of successful algorithms or techniques that can be used to create a chatbot in JavaScript that generates creative responses comparable to or better than humans? Additionally, can you explain how to use Markdown format to present arguments and evidence in a clear and organized manner?\\nHere is an example of a successful algorithm for generating creative responses in a chatbot using JavaScript and JSON data:\\n{\\n  \"greetings\": [\"Hello!\", \"Hi there!\", \"Greetings!\"],\\n  \"questions\": [\"How can I assist you today?\", \"What can I help you with?\", \"How may I be of service?\"],\\n  \"responses\": {\\n    \"greeting\": [\"Hello!

Please hold on.\"],\\n    \"thankyou\": [\"You\\'re welcome!\", \"My pleasure!\", \"Anytime!\"]\\n  }\\n}\\nTo use this algorithm, the chatbot can randomly select a greeting or question from the respective arrays, and respond accordingly. The responses object contains different responses for different situations, such as when the user greets the chatbot, asks a question, or expresses gratitude.\\nAs for using Markdown format, it is a lightweight markup language that allows you to format text with simple syntax. To present arguments and evidence in a clear and organized manner using Markdown, you can use headings, lists, and emphasis to structure your content. For example:\\n# Introduction\\nIn this essay, I will argue that chatbots can generate creative responses comparable to or better than humans. \\n## Background\\nChatbots have been around for decades, but recent advances in artificial intelligence and natural language processing have made them more sophisticated than ever before. \\n## Evidence\\nStudies have shown that chatbots can accurately answer a wide range of questions and provide personalized recommendations to users. Furthermore, chatbots can learn from their interactions with users and improve over time. \\n## Conclusion\\nIn conclusion, chatbots have the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with technology and each other. By leveraging the power of AI and natural language processing, chatbots can provide creative and helpful responses that rival those of humans.'],\n",
